## Question 1

![Supply and Demand Curve](/images/supply-and-demand.png)

Coming from a computer science background, [supply and demand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_and_demand) curves don't make much sense to me. [Demand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demand_curve) is more intuitive because it is reasonable to assume that agents have diminishing returns in utility of consumption. This means that the marginal utility gain an agent gets from consuming an additional bundle of good <b>X</b> decreases with each bundle they buy. Given a price <b>p</b> per good of <b>X</b>, after consuming <b>t\*</b> goods an agent will prefer their <b>p</b> dollars over another unit of <b>X</b>. Hence, if an agent's preferences remains constant, <b>t\*</b> will increase if <b>p</b> decreases.

[Supply curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_(economics)) on the other hand make very little sense to me. Investopedia defines the [Law of Supply](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lawofsupply.asp) as:
<center><blockquote>
All other factors being equal, as the price of a good or service increases, the quantity of that good or service that suppliers offer will increase, and vice versa.
</blockquote></center>
Sorry. Where is the incentive for suppliers to offer more goods at a higher price? If price determines demand, then supplying more or less goods than the amount demanded will result in reduced profits by either having surplus product or leaving money on the table. If a supplier has a fixed amount of product they want to clear, there is a price (or sequence of decreasing prices) that will clear the supply with maximal profit. I need to see a model of a supplier's fixed and recurring costs for producing <b>y</b> bundles of the good <b>X</b> incorporated into these curves in order to be convinced that raising supply implies raising profits. This seems to only be the case if price is too low and demand exceeds supply. I'm missing the relationship to raising prices. There seems to be something missing from this Econ 101 explanation.
