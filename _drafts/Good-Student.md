How to be a good student

* What am I trying to learn from this instructor, in this class, specifically?
* What are they trying to teach me? Which points should I work to retain?
* What knowledge will fill the gap in my understanding about a particular topic?

## Who to learn from

One of my favorite quotes is:
<center>
"A wise man can learn more from a foolish question than a fool can learn from a wise answer." (Bruce Lee)
</center>
One of my teachers interpreted a similar concept as "the wisest man can learn from anyone."



* "Where am I now" and "How do I get to Point B" -- ask instructors
* "Where do I want to go" and "why" -- is for introspection or learning from friends / instructors about their goals / journey or learning from experimenting
* "Why do I always do \[X\] or can't I do \[Y\]" -- you need practice :)
