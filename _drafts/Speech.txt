title: On Free Speech
---



- It is 2023 and I find myself in an age in which it is dangerous to have and express an opinion.
- How did we get here? It started with Thanksgiving family dinner: you don't talk about politics. Soon people drew the lines -- if you are Republican you don't associate with Democrats; if you are Democrat, all Republicans are biggots.
- Moderates are crushed, nuance fails; you have to pick a side. It's my-way-or-the-high-way. Not only, but you must have always been that way -- statements are pulled out of context so that something
- If you have any opinion that differs from the party-line, it's betrayal to the cult, a moral wrong and legal crime. 


Online...
- On youtube, people know which terms and topics to not get shadow banned
- Twitter's policy of "speech not reach" is emblematic. It is the minimum that a private company can do to respect free speech.
Three recent events have highlighted my view that ...
- Biden's administration appealing the court to eliminate the First Amendment
- Amazon's house arrest
- UK's 3300 arrests as opposed 300 in Russia for free speech, in 2023 so far.



I write this staking my belief in the moral richeousness of free speech. I am aware that my opinions on this topic can get me expelled from my institution, fired from my job, blacklisted from any future associates, doxxed and harassed, imprisoned, and executed. <LINK TO THESE>. I believe free speech is important enough defend. <ACTUALLY NO, I'LL PROBABLY LEAVE THE COUNTRY FIRST.>
