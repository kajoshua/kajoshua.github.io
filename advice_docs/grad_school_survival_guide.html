				<p>A computer science graduate school survival guide, intended for prospective
					or novice graduate students. This guide describes what I wish I had known
					at the start of graduate school but had to learn the hard way instead.
					It focuses on mental toughness and the skills a graduate student needs.
					The guide also discusses finding a job after completing the Ph.D. and points
					to many other related web pages.</p>

				<ul>
					<li>This guide covers the traits and skills that separate the star

					<li>If you don’t have a good reason for pursuing the Ph.D., then
					get a Master’s degree instead.</li>
					
					<li>A Ph.D. program is very different from getting a Bachelor’s
					degree, and you must treat it as a strange type of job.  Initiative, 
					tenacity, flexibility, interpersonal skills, organizational skills,
					and communication skills are all critical and not things that 
					universities typically test for in selecting incoming students.</li>
					
					<li>A Ph.D. is a means to an end: employment in a startup, commercial
					business, government or industrial research lab, or academia.  This
					guide explains the characteristics of these four career
					choices.</li>

					<li>If you spend 15 minutes reading the rest of this guide, you might increase

			<div class="contentQuote">“To know the road ahead, ask those coming back.”</div>
			<div class="contentQuoteAuthor"><p>- Chinese proverb</p></div>
			<div class="contentText">
				<p>In February 1995, on a beautiful sunny day with clear Carolina blue
				skies, I turned in the final, signed copy of my dissertation. The graduate
				school staff member did some last-minute checks on the document and pronounced
				it acceptable. After six and a half years of toil and sweat, I was finally
				done! While walking back to the C.S. department building, I was sorely
				disappointed that the heavens didn‘t part, with trumpet-playing angels
				descending to announce this monumental occasion. Upon hearing this observation,
				<a href="http://www.cs.unc.edu/%7Ebrooks/">Dr. Fred Brooks</a> 
				(one of my committee members) commented, “And the sad fact
				is, you’re no smarter today than you were yesterday.” 
				“That’s true,” I replied, “but the important thing 
				is that I am smarter than I was six and a half years ago.”</p>

				<p>I wrote the first version of this guide two years after graduating, after 
				reflecting upon my graduate student career. One thought that has repeatedly
				struck me is how much easier graduate school might have been if somehow,
				magically, some of the things I knew when I turned in my dissertation I
				could have known when I first entered graduate school. Instead, I had to
				learn those the hard way. Of course, for many topics this is impossible:
				the point of graduate school is to learn those by going through the experience.
				However, I believe other lessons can be taught ahead of time. Unfortunately,
				such guidance is rarely offered. While I had to learn everything the hard
				way, new graduate students might benefit from my experiences and what I
				learned. That is the purpose of this guide.</p>
				
				<p>Very little of this guide discusses technical matters. Technical skills,
				intelligence and creativity are certainly strong factors for success in
				graduate school. For example, I doubt there is a C.S. graduate student
				who didn’t at one point wish he or she had a stronger mathematical background.
				However, it’s beyond the scope of this guide to tell you how to be technically
				brilliant, as the following joke implies:</p>

				<p>You don’t have to be a genius to do well in graduate school. You must be
				reasonably intelligent, but after a certain point, I think other traits
				become more important in determining success.</p>
				
				<p>This guide covers the character traits and social skills that often
				separate the “star” graduate students from the ordinary ones. 
				Who are the students who are self-motivated, take initiative, find ways 
				around obstacles, communicate well both orally and in writing, and get along 
				well enough with their committee and other department members to marshal resources
				to their cause? Which students seem to know “how the system works” and
				manage to get things done? These traits are hardly unique to succeeding
				in graduate school; they are the same ones vital to success in academic
				or industrial careers, which is probably why many of the best graduate
				students that I knew were ones who had spent some time working before they
				came back to school.</p>
				
				<p>This document is aimed at junior C.S. graduate students, but these observations
				are probably broad enough to apply to graduate education in other technical
				fields. My conclusions are certainly colored by my particular experiences
				(doing my dissertation work in interactive computer graphics in the 
				<a href="http://www.cs.unc.edu/">Computer Science department of the University 
				of North Carolina at Chapel Hill</a>) but I think they are fairly general in 
				application and should be of interest to readers at other schools and other C.S. 
				specialties. Obviously, these are only my opinions and may not represent the views 
				of other sane individuals or organizations. Some points may be controversial, but 
				if they weren’t this would not be interesting reading. Parts of this document 
				come from two informal talks I gave at UNC about “the Ph.D. job hunt” 
				and “observations from spending one year in industrial research.” Both 
				talks had larger audiences than any informal <em>technical</em> talk I gave at 
				UNC, which told me that students are definitely interested in these subjects!</p>

				<p>This guide does not discuss how to be accepted for admission into graduate
				school.  I have never been a professor, so I do not have insights to share
				on how professors decide which students to admit.  For one professor’s
				view, read 
				<a href="http://matt.might.net/articles/how-to-apply-and-get-in-to-graduate-school-in-science-mathematics-engineering-or-computer-science/">

			<div class="contentTitle">Why get a Ph.D.?</div>
			<div class="contentQuote">“Being a graduate student is like becoming all of the 
				Seven Dwarves.  In the beginning, you’re Dopey and Bashful. In the middle, 
				you are usually sick (Sneezy), tired (Sleepy), and irritable (Grumpy). But at 
				the end, they call you Doc, and then you’re Happy.”
			</div>
			<div class="contentQuoteAuthor"><p>- yours truly</p></div>

			<div class="contentText">
				<p>The most basic question every Ph.D. student must know the answer to
				is: “Why the hell am I doing this?”</p>

				<p>It’s a good question. The hours are long. The pay is low, with minimal
				benefits. After graduation, Ph.D. salaries are higher than B.S. and M.S.
				salaries, but the difference doesn’t make up for the income lost by staying
				in school longer. The M.S. has a better “bucks for the time invested” 
				ratio than the Ph.D. does. And in terms of social status, a graduate student
				doesn’t rank very high on the ladder.</p>
				
				<p>If you do not have an acceptable answer to this question, then don’t
				get a Ph.D. <b><em>I repeat: if you do not have a rock-solid reason for getting
				the Ph.D., then it is better that you leave with a Master’s.</em></b></p>
				
				<p>Why? Completing a Ph.D. is a long, hard road with many potholes and
				washed out bridges along the way. You may run over some land mines and
				have to stop and turn around and explore other routes. If the goal is important
				enough to you, then these obstacles will not prevent you from completing
				your journey. But if you don’t know why you are on this road, then you
				will get discouraged and will probably leave without finishing, having
				wasted years of your life.</p>
				
				<p>I faced this situation after the first time I took the Doctoral Written
				Exam (which at the time was the entrance examination into the Ph.D. program).
				I missed passing it by just 4 percentage points. I then had to decide whether
				or not to try again next semester (committing myself again to spending
				months getting ready for the test) or to just leave with an M.S. degree.</p>
				
				<p>I didn’t come to graduate school with the Ph.D. as the primary goal.
				So this test result forced me to answer the basic question “Why the hell
				am I doing this?” After much soul searching, I found my answer and decided
				to take the test again, passed it, and went on to get my Ph.D.</p>
				
				<p>I got the Ph.D. because I wanted to get a research position after leaving
				graduate school. I wanted to work with the state of the art and extend
				it. I did not want to “bring yesterday’s technology one step closer 
				to tomorrow.” I wanted a job that would I find interesting, challenging and
				stimulating. While an M.S. would give me a chance at landing a research
				position, the Ph.D. would give me a much better chance. And I did not want
				to live with regrets. If I took the Doctoral Written Exam again and failed
				again, then I could say that it wasn’t meant to be and move on with my
				life. I would have no regrets because I had given it my best shot and was
				not able to make it. However, if I left with an M.S. without taking the
				test a second time, and five years later I was in a job that was boring
				and uninteresting, then I would have to lie awake every night for the rest
				of my life wondering “What if?” What if I had taken the test again and
				passed? Would I then be in the job that I really wanted? That was not a
				situation I wanted to be in. I did not want to live the rest of my life
				regretting what might have been.</p>
				
				<p>In hindsight, I think one of the main reasons I successfully completed
				the Ph.D. was the fact that I <em>didn’t</em> pass the exam on the first
				try. It’s ironic, but life sometimes works in strange ways. That initial
				failure caused me to answer the basic question, providing the mental fortitude
				to keep going despite the hurdles and problems I would later face.</p>
				
				<p>My answer is you should get a Ph.D. if it is required for your goals
				after graduate school, such as becoming a professor or a researcher in
				academia, government or industry. Your answer may differ from mine. As
				long as you have an answer that you believe in passionately, then that’s
				enough. If you don’t have an answer, then save yourself a lot of grief
				and don't get the Ph.D.</p>

				<p>The best answer to this question I have ever seen comes from 
				<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Lipscomb">William Lipscomb</a>, 
				a Nobel Prize winner in chemistry.  He said, <em>“With a
				Ph.D. you will have a better chance of spending the rest of your life doing
				what you want to do, instead of what someone else wants you to do.”</em>
				</p>

				many people who provide their opinions about why someone should or should not 
				pursue a Ph.D.</a></p>

			<div class="contentTitle">Academia is a business</div>
			<div class="contentQuote">“Remember the Golden Rule: 
			Those who have the gold make the rules.”</div>
			<div class="contentQuoteAuthor"><p></p></div>

			<div class="contentText">
				<p>Academia is a business, and “graduate student” is a 
				job title. This is especially true at private universities. Academia 
				is very peculiar type of business. It is certainly not the Real World 
				and does not work in the same way that the ordinary corporate world does. 
				However, it is a business nonetheless and as a graduate student, you must 
				treat it that way. Graduate school made a lot more sense and became much 
				easier for me after I realized this. If you think of graduate school as 
				an “Ivory Tower” free of politics, money problems, and 
				real-world concerns, you are going to be severely disappointed.
				If you don’t believe me, read <em>The Idea Factory</em> by Pepper White 
				(listed in the references) for one account of graduate life at MIT.</p>

				<p>A few graduate students are independently wealthy or have fellowship
				and scholarship money that cover all their expenses 
				in graduate school. Such students are rare, however. Most of us needed
				financial support, in the form of Teaching Assistantships or Research 
				Assistantships (RA’s). In general, RA’s are more desirable to 
				students since those can directly fund the research you need to finish.</p>
				
				<p>Where does the money come from to fund RA’s? Your professors have to
				raise funds from external organizations. These include government agencies
				such as the National Science Foundation (NSF), Defense Advanced Research
				Projects Agency (DARPA), the Office of Naval Research (ONR), and others.
				Private companies also fund some university research, and as government funding
				has become harder to get. private sources have become more important.  For
				example, Intel spends tens of millions of dollars a year funding university
				research centers.  These organizations don’t just give money away as charity. 
				They expect their money to accomplish something. Increasingly these days, 
				this takes the form of a contract for a working demonstration that must be 
				shown at the end. That means once the money is delivered, your professors 
				must come through with the working demonstration. It is rare that they do 
				this by themselves. Instead, they find some very capable, young, 
				self-motivated people who are willing to work long hours for small amounts 
				of pay. In other words, they fund RA’s.</p>

				<p>The RA job is crucial to the academic business. If the RA’s cannot 
				successfully conduct the research, then the demonstration will not work in 
				the end and the funding agencies may not be happy. They may choose to not 
				fund your professor in the future, which will bring his or her research 
				program to a halt. And there are many professors and other researchers 
				chasing too few research dollars these days; it is a competitive market. 
				Thus, each professor wants the best students available. These students are 
				the most capable ones who can get the research done required to fulfill the 
				funding contracts.</p>

				<p>That means you must treat an RA like a job. You must prove to your professors
				that you are capable of getting the work done, being a team player, communicating
				your results, and most of the other characteristics needed to do well in
				regular jobs. That’s why many of the upcoming sections in this guide sound
				like ones written for the regular workplace.</p>

				<p>What do you get out of this? At the start, you may have to do tasks
				specifically related to the funding contracts. But eventually your professor
				must be flexible enough to fund your own specific research program that
				leads to the completion of your dissertation. Your stipend and tuition
				waiver should be enough to live on frugally without going into debt. You
				will learn the state of the art in your chosen speciality and conduct cutting-edge
				research on a subject that you find interesting and enjoyable. If you don’t
				find this compensation sufficient, then you shouldn’t be in graduate school
				in the first place.</p>

				<p>The bottom line: realize that academia is a peculiar kind of business
				and the role you play in this enterprise. If you do your job well (and
				have good negotiation and interpersonal skills, as discussed in future
				sections), both your needs and your professors’ needs will be met. But
				don’t enter an RA position thinking that the computers, research equipment,
				staff members and other resources that you are provided with are your birthright.
				Don’t take them for granted! Most of those exist only because your professors
				have been able to raise the money to provide those to you. In turn, you
				must fulfill your end of the deal by doing great research with those resources.
				If you don’t do your job well, don’t be surprised if your professors 
				choose to not fund you in the future. They do not <em>have</em> to provide you 
				with an RA job or let you use the computing equipment they acquired. And the
				student who has no funding, no tuition reimbursement and no access to required
				computing resources is the student who leaves the university that semester.</p>
				
				<p>How do you make sure you are one of those best, highly desired RA’s?
				Read on!</p>

			<div class="contentQuote">“The IQ test was invented to predict academic

				<p>If you go through a Ph.D. program, you will find graduate school a very
				different world from undergraduate school. If you just get an M.S., then
				graduate school may not be much different from undergrad (depending on
				where you get your degree), except that the courses are deeper and more
				advanced. But for a Ph.D. student, graduate school is a whole new ballgame.
				The students who do well are the ones who learn this earlier rather than
				later and make the necessary adjustments.</p>

				<p>Jason Hong has an article on this theme called <a href="http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2013/7/165494-phd-students-must-break-away-from-undergraduate-mentality/abstract">Ph.D. Students Must Break Away From Undergraduate Mentality (ACM digital
				library subscription required for access)</a>.
				
				</p><p>Graduate school is not primarily about taking courses. You will take
				classes in the beginning but in your later years you probably won’t 
				have any classes. People judge a recently graduated Ph.D. by his or her 
				research, not by his or her class grades. And, without any offense to my 
				professors, most of what you learn in a Ph.D. program comes outside of 
				classes: from doing research on your own, attending conferences, and 
				discussions with your fellow students. Success in graduate school does not 
				come from completing a set number of course units but rather from 
				successfully completing a research program.</p>
				
				<p>Graduate school is more like an apprenticeship where each student has
				his or her own project, and the masters may or may not be particularly
				helpful. It’s like teaching swimming by tossing students into the deep
				end of the pool and seeing who makes it to the other end alive and who
				drowns. It’s like training clock designers by locking students inside a
				clock factory with some working clocks and lots of clock parts and machines
				for building clocks. However, the instructions are at best incomplete and
				even the masters themselves don’t know exactly how to build next 
				year’s models.</p>
				
				<p>Excelling in a Ph.D. program requires different skills than doing well
				in undergrad. Undergraduate education tests you through class projects
				(that do not last more than a semester), essays, midterms and finals. For
				the most part, you work alone. Your professor may not know your name. Every
				other student in your class takes the same tests or does similar projects.
				But in a Ph.D. program, you must select and complete a unique long-term
				research program. For most of us, this means you have to learn <em>how</em>
				to do research and all that entails: working closely with your professors,
				staff and fellow students, communicating results, finding your way around
				obstacles, dealing with politics, etc.</p>

				<p><a href="http://shouldigetaphd.com/#vogel">Carl Vogel</a> suggests the
				most important personality traits of successful graduate students are being
				inquisitive, disciplined, obsessive and delusional (certain that their 
				research programs will uncover something new and important).</p>

				<p>I’m not saying that tests and grades are completely unimportant 
				in graduate school. One of the two biggest hurdles in completing a Ph.D. 
				is passing the qualifying exam. (The other is finding an acceptable 
				dissertation topic.) But because graduate school is not nearly as 
				exam-based as undergraduate education and requires different skills, the 
				GRE and undergraduate grades are not as good an indicator of who will 
				excel and who will drop out as admission committees seem to think. Those 
				tests do not measure creativity, tenacity, interpersonal skills, oral 
				presentation skills, and many other important traits.</p>


				<p>The next several sections discuss these traits.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="contentTitle">Initiative</div>
			<div class="contentQuote">“The difference between people who exercise 
			initiative and those who don’t is literally the difference between 
			night and day. I’m not talking about a 25 to 50 percent difference 
			in effectiveness; I’m talking about a 5000-plus percent difference, 
			particularly if they are smart, aware, and sensitive to others.”</div>
			<div class="contentQuoteAuthor"><p>- Stephen R. Covey, 
			<em>The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People</em></p></div>

			<div class="contentText">
				<p>The dissertation represents a focused, personal research effort where
				you take the lead on your own, unique project. If you expect that your
				advisor is going to hold your hands and tell you what to do every step
				of the way, you are missing the point of the dissertation. Ph.D. students
				must show initiative to successfully complete the dissertation. This does
				not mean that guidance from professors is unimportant, just that this guidance
				should be at a reasonably high level, not at a micromanaging level. If
				you never do any tasks except those that your professor specifically tells
				you to do, then you need to work on initiative.</p>

				<p>At UNC, there is a famous anecdote about a former UNC graduate student
				named Joe Capowski. Many years ago, UNC got a pair of force-feedback mechanical
				arms to use with molecular visualization and docking experiments. The problem
				was how to move them to UNC. These mechanical arms were large, heavy beasts,
				and were in Argonne National Labs in Chicago, IL. Unfortunately, there
				was a trucker’s strike going on at the time. Joe Capowski, on his own 
				initiative (and without telling anyone), flew out to Argonne, rented a truck, 
				drove the mechanical arms all the way back to North Carolina, and then handed
				the computer science department the bill! Many years later, Joe Capowski
				ran for the Chapel Hill city council and won a seat. Prof. Fred Brooks
				gave him an endorsement. I still remember the words Dr. Brooks said: 
				“I may not agree with his politics, but I know he’ll get things 
				done.” (Thanks to Jim Lipscomb for corrections to this anecdote.)</p>
				
				<p>While the Joe Capowski anecdote is perhaps a bit extreme, it does show
				that it is often better to ask forgiveness than permission, provided you
				are not becoming a 
				“<a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=loose%20cannon">loose
				cannon.</a>” Certain universities 
				(e.g. MIT) are good at fostering a “can do” attitude among 
				their graduate students, and therefore they become more assertive and 
				productive. One of the hallmarks of a senior graduate student is that he 
				or she knows the types of tasks that require permission and those that 
				don’t. That knowledge will come with experience. Generally, 
				the senior graduate students have the most freedom to take 
				initiative on projects. This privilege has to be earned. The more that 
				you have proven that you can work independently and initiate and complete 
				appropriate tasks, the more your professors will leave you alone to do 
				what you want to do.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="contentTitle">Tenacity</div>
			<div class="contentQuote">“Let me tell you the secret that has led me 
			to my goal. My strength lies solely in my tenacity.”</div>
			<div class="contentQuoteAuthor"><p>- Louis Pasteur</p></div>

			<div class="contentText">

				<p>You don’t need to be a genius to earn a Ph.D. (although it doesn’t 	
				hurt). But nobody finishes a dissertation without being tenacious. A 
				dissertation usually takes several years to complete. This can be a culture 
				shock to former undergraduates who have never worked on a project that 
				lasted longer than one quarter or semester (at the end of which, whatever 
				the state of the project, one declares victory and then goes home). No one 
				can tell you in advance exactly how long the dissertation will take, so 
				it’s hard to see where the “end of the road” lies. You 
				will encounter unexpected problems and obstacles that can add months or 
				years to the project. It’s very easy to become depressed and unmotivated 
				about going on. If you are not tenacious about working on the dissertation, 
				you won’t finish.</p>
			
				<p>Tenacity means sticking with things even when you get depressed or when
				things aren’t going well. For example, I did not enjoy my first year of
				graduate school. I didn’t tell anyone this until after leaving UNC. I was
				not on a project and was focused on taking classes, some of which I didn’t
				do all that well in. I didn’t feel a part of the Department, and really
				wondered whether or not I fit in. Still, I stuck with it and when summer
				rolled around and I got a job in the Department, I became much more involved
				in research and enjoyed graduate school much more. Part of earning a Ph.D.
				is building a “thick skin” so you are not so fragile that you will 
				give up at the first sign on any difficulties.</p>

				<p>One lesson I learned as a graduate student is the best way to finish
				the dissertation is to do something every day that gets you closer to being
				done. If all you have left is writing, then write part of the dissertation
				<em>every day</em>. If you still have research to do, then do part of it
				<em>every day</em>. Don’t just do it when you are “in the 
				mood” or feeling productive. This level of discipline will keep you 
				going through the good times and the bad and will ensure that you finish.</p>

			<div class="contentTitle">Flexibility</div>
			<div class="contentQuote">“Back in graduate school, I’d learned how 
			to survive without funding, power, or even office space. Grad students are 
			lowest in the academic hierarchy, and so they have to squeeze resources from 
			between the cracks. When you’re last on the list for telescope time, you 
			make your observations by hanging around the mountaintop, waiting for a slice 
			of time between other observers.  When you need an electronic gizmo in the lab, 
			you borrow it in the evening, use it all night, and return it before anyone 
			notices. I didn’t learn much about planetary physics, but weaseling came 
			naturally.”</div>

			</p></div>
			<div class="contentQuote">“The Chinese call luck opportunity and they say

			not enough to hear opportunity knock. You must let him in, greet him, make 
			friends and work together.”</div>
			<div class="contentQuoteAuthor"><p>- Bernard Gittelson</p></div>

			<div class="contentText">
				<p>Flexibility means taking advantage of opportunities and synergies, working
				around problems, and being willing to change plans as required. As a graduate
				student, you are on the 
				<a href="http://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/low+man+on+the+totem+pole">bottom
				of the academic totem pole</a>. Even undergraduates
				can rank higher, especially at private universities (because they actually
				pay tuition!) You cannot <em>order</em> anybody to do anything. In general,
				you will be in the position of reacting to big events rather than controlling
				them. Therefore, you must be flexible in your approach and research program.</p>
				
				<p>For example, you may not have as much access to a piece of laboratory
				equipment as you would like, or maybe access is suddenly cut off due to
				events beyond your control. What do you do? Can you find a replacement?
				Or reduce the time needed on that equipment? Or come in at odd hours when
				no normal person uses that equipment? Or redefine the direction of your
				project so that equipment is no longer required?</p>
				
				<p>Events can be good as well as bad. The difference between the highly
				effective graduate student and the average one is that the former recognizes
				those opportunities and takes advantage of them. I had nothing to do with
				bringing <a href="http://www.cs.unc.edu/%7Egb/">Gary Bishop</a> to UNC. But
				after he arrived, I realized my research would progress much faster if he
				became my advisor so I made the switch and that was a big help to my graduate
				student career. Opportunities for synergy and serendipity do occur, but
				one has to be flexible enough to recognize them and take advantage of them.</p>

				<p>Computer Science majors are not, in general, known for their interpersonal
				skills. Some of us got into this field because it is easier to understand
				machines than people. As frustrating as computers can be, they at least
				behave in a logical manner, while human beings often do not. However, your
				success in graduate school and beyond depends a great deal upon your ability
				to build and maintain interpersonal relationships with your advisor, your
				committee, your research and support staff and your fellow students. This
				does not mean you must become the “life of the party.” I am not 
				and never will be a gregarious, extroverted person. But I did make a serious 
				effort to learn and practice interpersonal skills, and those were crucial to my
				graduate student career and my subsequent jobs in industrial research.</p>
				
				<p>Why should this matter, you may ask? If one is technically brilliant,
				shouldn’t that be all that counts? The answer is no, because the situation
				is different from your undergraduate days. In both graduate school and
				in business, you must depend upon and work with other people to achieve
				your goals To put this in perspective, I have excerpted the following from
				an article called “Organizations: The Soft and Gushy Side” by 
				Kerry J. Patterson, published in the Fall 1991 issue of <em>The Bent:</em></p>

			</div>
			
			<div class="contentIndented">
				<p>I first learned of the capricious, human side of organizations some
				15 years ago while studying the careers of engineers and scientists. The
				research design required that I spend eight hours a day in one-on-one interviews.
				For two hours I'd ask “career” questions of an engineer, chemist, 
				physicist, or applied mathematician -- all of whom worked for a Fortune 500 
				firm. During these 120 minutes, the subjects talked about the perils of the 
				organizations. Two hours was scarcely enough time to share their stories. All 
				energetically discussed their personal careers. Most had been frustrated with 
				the “soft and gushy” side of organizations. Some had figured out 
				the system and learned to master it. Others had not.</p>
				
				<p>As part of the research design, we asked to talk to low, medium, and
				high performers. This in itself was an interesting exercise. To determine
				performance rankings, we would place in front of a senior manager the names
				of the 10-50 people within his or her organization. Each name would be
				typed neatly in the middle of a three-by-five card. After asking the manager
				to rank the employees from top to bottom, the managers would then go through
				a card sort. Typically the executive would sort the names into three or
				four piles and then resort each pile again. Whatever the strategy, the
				exercise usually took only minutes. Just like that, the individual in charge
				of the professionals in question was able to rank, from top to bottom,
				as many as 50 people. It rarely took more than three minutes and a couple
				of head scratches and grunts. Three minutes. Although politics may appear
				ambiguous to those on the receiving end, those at the top were able to
				judge performance with crystal clarity.</p>
				
				<p>This performance ranking (conducted by individuals not involved in the
				interviews) was then used as a dependent measure. Those of us conducting
				the interviews attempted to surface information (independent measures)
				that would predict the ranking. What about a scientist’s career 
				would lead to a top ranking? What trashed a perfectly good career? Surely 
				scientific prowess would have an impact. And it did.</p>

				<p>But technological prowess wasn’t as predictive as another factor. We
				discovered that we could tell what performance group the interviewees belonged
				to within a minute or two by their attitudes toward people and politics.
				Individuals who were ranked low by their managers spoke of organizational
				politics as if it were poison. They were exceptionally annoyed by the people
				side of the business. They frequently stated they would rather be left
				alone to conduct their research untrammeled by human emotions. They 
				characterized the social side of organizations as “soft and gushy.” 
				They sounded like Spock turned bitter.</p>
				
				<p>Top performers, in contrast, found a way to work within the political
				system. They hadn’t exactly embraced politics. They didn’t appear like
				that toothy kid you knew back in college who lived to fight political battles.
				They didn’t come off as glad-handling sales folks. These were professional
				scientists who were often top ranked in their field. They looked and talked
				liked scientists. The difference between them and those ranked at the bottom
				of the totem pole was clear. They had found a way to make peace with organizations,
				people, and politics. They climbed to the top of their field by mastering
				both hard things and soft and gushy people.</p>

				<p>Engineers and scientists aren’t the only ones who find the human side
				of the organizations to be annoying. As we expanded our research to include
				professors, accountants, and other professionals, the findings were remarkably
				similar. All found political machinations to be distasteful. It’s just
				that some had found a way to master the social aspects -- the top performers.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="contentText">
				<p>Students usually look down on politics, but politics in its most basic,
				positive form is simply the art of getting things done. Politics is mostly
				about who is allowed to do what and who gets the resources (money, people,
				equipment, etc.) To succeed in your research, you will need resources,
				both capital and personnel. Interpersonal skills are mandatory for acquiring
				those resources. If you are incapable of working with certain people or
				make them mad at you, you will not get those resources and will not complete
				your research.</p>
				<p>Furthermore, people who complete a Ph.D. generally have careers where
				they take leadership roles.  Leadership requires good interpersonal skills
				to convince and motivate others to think a certain way or to take certain
				actions.  If you do not have good interpersonal or “soft” skills,
				the amount of influence you will have will be restricted to yourself.  Your
				potential will be limited.</p>
				<p>Here is an example of how relationships are important:  As a graduate 
				student, which group of people did I try my best to avoid offending?
				Was it my committee? No, because healthy disagreements and negotiations
				with your advisor and committee are crucial to graduating within a reasonable
				amount of time. Nor was it my fellow students, because I did not need help
				from most of them, and most of them did not need me. The critical group
				was the <em>research and support staff</em>. These include the research faculty
				and all the various support positions (the system administrators, network
				administrators, audio-visual experts, electronic services, optical and
				mechanical engineers, and above all, the administrative assistants). 
				<em>I needed their help to get my research done, but they did not directly 
				need me.</em>  Consequently, I made it a priority to establish and maintain 
				good working relationships with them.</p>
				
				<p>Cultivating interpersonal relationships is mostly about treating people
				with respect and determining their different working styles. Give credit
				where credit is due. Acknowledge and thank them for their help. Return
				favors. Respect their expertise, advice and time. Apologize if you are
				at fault. Realize that different people work in different ways and are
				motivated by different things -- the more you understand this diversity,
				the better you will be able to interact and motivate them to help you.
				For certain people, offering to buy them dinner or giving them free basketball
				tickets can work wonders.</p>

				<p>A true example: at one point in my research, I needed to make significant
				modifications to some low-level code in the graphics computer called 
				“Pixel Planes 5.” Doing this required expertise that I did not 
				have, but another graduate student named 
				<a href="http://www.csee.umbc.edu/~olano/">Marc Olano</a> did. How should I 
				tap into Marc’s expertise and get the changes I needed done?</p>
				
				<p>The wrong way is to go up to Marc, explain the problem, and get him
				to make the changes. Marc doesn’t need the changes done; I do. 
				Therefore, I should do most of the work. Expecting him to do the work 
				shows disrespect of his time.</p>
				
				<p>What I actually did was to explain the problem to Marc and he sketched
				out a possible solution. Then I ran off and worked on my own for a few
				days, trying to implement the solution. I got part of it working, but ended
				up getting stuck on another part. Only at that point did I go back to Marc
				and ask him for help. By doing this, I showed that I respected his time
				and wanted to minimize his burden, thus making him more willing to help
				me. Months later, when he and <a href="http://www.cs.jhu.edu/%7Ecohen/">Jon
				Cohen </a>needed my help in setting up a system to demonstrate some of
				their software, I was more than happy to return the favor.</p>
				
				<p>Interpersonal interaction is a huge subject and goes far beyond my description
				here. All I can really do in this section is (hopefully) convince you that
				these skills are vital to your graduate student career and encourage you
				to learn more if you need to improve these skills. I still have a lot to
				learn myself. I recommend reading <em>The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People</em>
				and <em>Type Talk</em> (both listed in the References section) as starting
				points. The magazine article “How to be a star engineer” (listed
				in the References) also touches on this subject.</p>

				<p>Since academia is a type of business, you will have responsibilities
				that you must uphold. You will be asked to greet and talk with visitors,
				give demos, show up to meetings, get projects done on time, etc. If you
				are not well organized, you will have a difficult time meeting those obligations.

				<p>There are many different time management and organization skills, and

				not going to describe them. Find one that works for you and use it. I can
				highly recommend

				(by minimizing the combined time of putting away and locating a piece of 
				information). All that really matters is whether or not it works.</p>
				
				<p>One metaphor I found useful is the following: Organize your tasks as
				if you were juggling them. Juggling several balls requires planning and
				skill. You must grab and toss each ball before it hits the ground. You
				can only toss one ball at a time, just as you can only work on one task
				at a time. The order in which you toss the balls is crucial, much as the
				order of working on tasks often determines whether or not you meet all
				your deadlines. Finally, once you start a task (grab a ball) you want to
				get enough done so you can ignore it for a while (throw it high enough
				in the air so it won’t come down for a while). Otherwise you waste too
				much time in context switches between tasks. Do you see jugglers try to
				keep each ball at the same height above the ground, frantically touching
				every ball every second?</p>

				TV series.  That doesn’t mean dropping everything else in life, but

			<div class="contentTitle">Communication skills</div>
			<div class="contentQuote">“What is written without effort is, in general, 
			read without pleasure.”</div>
			<div class="contentQuoteAuthor"><p>- Samuel Johnson</p></div>
			<div class="contentQuote">“Present to inform, not to impress; if you 
			inform, you will impress.”</div>
			<div class="contentQuoteAuthor"><p>- Frederick P. Brooks, Jr.</p></div>

			<div class="contentText">
				<p>As a student, I was always amazed that articles written about business 
				consistently put good communication skills at or near the top of the list of 
				skills that employers want to see but often didn’t find in candidates. 
				Now, as someone who has worked in industry for a long time and also hired 
				people, I can confirm this is true.</p>

				<p>Communication skills, both written and oral, are vital for making a
				good impression as a Ph.D. student and as a researcher. At a minimum, you
				have to defend your dissertation with an oral presentation. But you should
				also expect to write technical papers and reports, give presentations at
				conferences, and give demonstrations to groups of visitors. If you can
				write and speak well, you will earn recognition and distinguish yourself
				from other graduate students. This is especially true when giving presentations
				in front of important visitors or at major conferences.</p>
				
				<p>Conversely, if you cannot communicate well, then your career opportunities
				after graduation will be limited. Professors spend most of their
				time communicating: teaching, fundraising, guiding graduate students, and
				documenting their results (through papers, videos, slidesets, etc.).
				In industry, we need people who can communicate well so they can work in
				teams, learn what businesses and customers need, present their results,
				raise funds, and transition to leadership roles in project and personnel
				management. If you are technically brilliant but are incapable of
				communicating or working with other people, then your results will be 
				limited to what you can accomplish alone and your career growth will have 
				a low ceiling, both in industry and academia.</p>

				<p>Unfortunately, not all graduate students receive training in giving
				presentations or writing technical documents (which are different from
				English essays). These are skills that can be learned! Don’t worry 
				if giving presentations and writing papers are not something that comes 
				naturally to you. I was not very comfortable giving oral presentations 
				when I started graduate school, so I made a concerted effort to learn 
				how to do so, by taking classes, reading about the subject, and 
				practicing. It’s not easy, but it’s well worth the investment. 
				If you need practice, try giving informal talks at research luncheons, 
				joining <a href="http://www.toastmasters.org/">Toastmasters</a>, 
				and studying good speakers to see what they do.</p>
				
				<p>Covering everything about this subject would fill a guide by itself, and would 
				probably be better explained in a video rather than a written document. But here 
				are a few basic points:</p>
				
				<ul>
				  	<li>Organization counts. Within the first few paragraphs or first few 
					minutes, tell me why I should read your paper or listen to your talk. 
					Make it clear where we are going and what we have already covered.</li>
     				<li>Make the text in your slides large enough so that people sitting in the
					back can read them. For large presentation halls, this usually means no
					more than 6-7 lines per slide and 28 point type minimum. You’d be 
					surprised how many experts on visualization (especially tenured professors!) 
					give presentations with unreadable slides.</li>
     				<li>Variety retains interest. Vary your pace, tone, and volume. Emphasize the
					important points. Look around the room. Throw in some video, pictures,
					or live examples.</li>
     				<li>Don’t stand in front of the screen and block everyone’s view. 
					You’d be surprised how often people do this without realizing it.</li>
     				<li>Point out the limitations of your work. That helps your credibility. 
					Similarly, credit others where appropriate.</li>
     				<li>Make friends with the A/V crew! Running A/V is a thankless job. 
					If everything runs smoothly, well, that’s what 
					was supposed to happen so nobody says anything. But if anything goes 
					wrong, the entire audience looks back at the control room. <em>Help the 
					A/V people help you.</em> Always check in early and test the equipment. 
					Tell them what you are going to do in your presentation (e.g., I’m 
					running 3 video segments). Make sure you know how everything works long 
					before you come up to the podium. And thank the A/V crew for their help 
					after you are done!</li>
			  	</ul>

				<p>Confidence is the key to giving a good presentation. And the way
				to gain confidence is to give good presentations. When you’re just starting
				out, this is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catch-22_%28logic%29">
				Catch-22</a>. However, once you become good enough, this turns into a 
				positive feedback cycle that can make giving talks a pleasure.</p>

				<p>If you want to see an example of an excellent talk, please watch 
				<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Really_Achieving_Your_Childhood_Dreams">
				The Last Lecture</a> by Randy Pausch 
				<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5_MqicxSo">(video available on YouTube)</a>.
				 I knew Randy personally, and I had
				the difficult task of having to speak directly after him, not once but
				twice.  Randy gave the talk of his life in The Last Lecture but I will tell
				you that was not an aberration.  He was a superb speaker, and someone we can
				all learn a lot from.  One time, after I spoke at the University of Virginia,
				Randy told me that he hadn’t realized I was such a dynamic speaker.
				I replied that it hadn’t come naturally for me, unlike Randy who was
				a naturally talented speaker.  For me, I had to work hard at it.  But I am
				proof that with hard work, one can develop good presentation skills and 
				get noticed by someone like Randy.</p>

				<p>A good reference on how to communicate in a compelling manner is the 
				book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Made-Stick-Ideas-Survive-Others/dp/1400064287/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1412373009&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=made+to+stick">
				Made to Stick: Why Some Ideas Survive and Others Die</a> by Chip and
				Dan Heath.  They give concrete approaches for crafting a message in
				a way that people will remember.</p>
				
				<p>Writing papers and getting them published is vital for Ph.D. students
				who want to get research positions after graduation. Your ability to write
				well significantly improves the chances that your paper will be accepted.
				When I was a young graduate student and reviewed a paper that I didn’t 
				understand, I thought “Gee, I must be dumb.” Today I will read 
				the same paper and think “Boy, this is a lousy paper. The authors did 
				not do a good job explaining and presenting their work.” Such a reaction
				is enough for me to reject the paper.</p>
				
				<p>Where do you submit your papers? Your professors will help you with
				this choice, but in general I would suggest shooting for the best conferences
				or journals where you think it has a reasonable chance of being accepted.
				It’s not much more work to write, submit and present a paper in a highly
				respected venue than in less respected venues. And if you don’t shoot for
				the top you’ll never know if it would have made it. The field of computer
				graphics is a bit unusual in that the most desirable place to publish is
				a conference (<a href="http://www.siggraph.org/">SIGGRAPH</a>), rather
				than a journal (although SIGGRAPH papers now are published in a journal called
				Transactions on Graphics). Be aware that journals can take years to publish 
				submitted papers; the turn-around time is much faster in a conference.</p>

				<p>Finally, don’t forget to communicate with your professors and your 
				teammates. Keep your committee appraised of your progress. One thing I do 
				(which few others do) is write short (1 screenfull) status reports, which 
				I religiously e-mailed to my professors and team members on a weekly basis. 
				These serve as an efficient way of keeping everyone up to date on what 
				I’m doing. They are also a good way for me to record my progress. 
				If I need to remember what I got done during a six month period, I have 
				plenty of old status reports that I can read. You’d be amazed how 
				appreciative professors and managers are of this simple practice. I also 
				throw in a different humorous quote at the end of each week’s report 
				to reward people for reading it.</p>

				<p>When you are working in the lab and you reach a milestone or achieve
				a result, let people know about it! Bring in your professors and fellow
				students and show it off! That’s a win-win situation. It lets others 
				know that you are making progress and achieving results, and you get valuable
				feedback and advice.</p>

			<div class="contentTitle">Choosing an advisor and a committee</div>
			<div class="contentQuote">“Some students in the lab are only nominally 
			supervised by a thesis advisor. This can work out well for people who are 
			independent self-starters. It has the advantage that you have only your own 
			neuroses to deal with, not your advisor’s as well.”</div>
			<div class="contentQuoteAuthor"><p>- from “How to do research at the 
			MIT AI Lab”</p></div>

			<div class="contentText">
				<p>The choice of an appropriate advisor is crucial to successfully 
				completing the Ph.D. Your advisor must be someone who can cover your 
				area of specialization and someone you can get along with. When I started 
				graduate school, I thought the advisor - student relationship was 
				supposed to be very close, both professionally and socially. In reality, 
				the relationship is whatever the professor and the student choose to 
				make of it. It can be close, with invited dinners at the professor’s 
				home, or it can be distant, e.g. meeting occasionally to remind 
				the professor that the student is still alive.</p>

				<p>One basic question in choosing an advisor is whether to pick a junior
				(non-tenured) or a senior (tenured) professor. Non-tenured professors tend
				to travel less and are generally more available. It is difficult to get
				help from an advisor who is never in town. Non-tenured faculty have fewer
				advisees that you have to compete with to get time with the professor.
				They are more likely to be personally involved with your research -- writing
				code, spending time in the lab at midnight, etc. Non-tenured faculty must
				be energetic and hard working if they want to be awarded tenure, and this
				work habit can rub off on their students. However, tenured faculty have
				several advantages as well. They are usually the ones with most of the
				money and resources to support you. They do not have to compete with their
				students for publications and recognition. The advisee does not run the
				risk of having his or her advisor not getting tenure and leaving the university.
				Tenured faculty are more experienced with “how the game works” and 
				thus may be better sources of guidance, personal contacts, jobs after 
				graduation, etc.</p>
				
				<p>I ended up with a non-tenured professor (actually, he was not even on
				the tenure track at the time) as my advisor, but also put several tenured
				professors on my committee, including some of the most senior ones in my
				specialty. In that way, I got the best of both worlds: the day-to-day attention
				from the primary advisor, combined with the resources and experience of
				the committee.</p>
				
				<p>Professors develop reputations amongst graduate students. Some are known
				to graduate their Ph.D. students rapidly. Others are impossible to get
				hold of, so their students take forever to finish or leave without graduating.
				Some dictate what their advisees have to do, while others are accommodating
				of student interests. Ask around. What you learn may be revealing. And
				if circumstances change to make another professor a more appropriate match
				to your needs, don’t be afraid to switch if that is an overall win.</p>

				<p>When picking a committee, you want to make sure they can cover all 
				areas of your thesis. You also want to make sure that it is likely that
				all the committee members will be available for meetings! Including too
				many professors who travel often will make it difficult to get all five
				or six together in one room for a three hour oral exam or proposal meeting.
				When scheduling such meetings, start by finding times when the difficult-to-reach
				professors are in town, and then add in the other committee members.</p>

				<p>When I was in graduate school, my top priority was crystal clear to
				me: getting out with a Ph.D. Other people described me as “focused like
				a laser beam” on that goal. In retrospect, I may have been too focused.
				There <em>is</em> more to life than graduate work. Keeping your health and
				your sanity intact are both vital to achieving the primary goal of getting
				out.</p>
				
				<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repetitive_strain_injury">

				subject. Over a dozen of my friends and coworkers have been inflicted with 
				this problem. In severe cases, RSI can be a career-ending injury. If you 
				can’t type, it’s rather difficult to write papers, computer

				Prevention is the way to go. When lifting weights, I exercise to 
				strengthen my shoulders and wrists as an additional preventative step.</p>
				
				<p>Earning a Ph.D. is like running a marathon. You have to learn to pace
				yourself and take care of your body if you want to reach the finish line.
				Unfortunately, students often act like sprinters trying to run a marathon. They
				are highly productive for a while, but then fall by the wayside because
				they aren’t eating correctly, exercising, taking time out to recharge their
				batteries, etc. You maximize your long-term productivity by not ignoring
				those other aspects. While I was in graduate school, I took time out to
				travel up and down the East Coast, from Boston down to Orlando. That was
				an important part of keeping my stress down and recharging my batteries.
				I also did some running and circuit training for exercise. For shorter
				breaks, I shot nerf basketballs at a tiny hoop mounted in the graphics
				lab and kept a guitar in my office. Figure out what works for you.</p>
				
				<p>It’s easy to lose perspective while in graduate school. You are 
				surrounded by so many other smart, hard working people that it is easy to 
				feel inferior and lose self esteem and confidence. But without an underlying 
				confidence that you <em>do</em> have what it takes to complete a 
				dissertation, it’s too easy to drop out when the going gets tough 
				instead of sticking it through.  I found it useful to keep in touch with 
				the “real world,” to remind myself that the graduate student 
				population is not representative of humanity in general and to keep my 
				perspective. You got into graduate school because you have already shown 
				to your professors that you have potential and skills that are not typical 
				among most college students, let alone most people -- don't forget that.</p>

				<p>I freely admit that this section reflects my personal bias that balance
				in life is important.  For some people, focusing on work to the exclusion
				of almost everything else is how they achieve excellence.  Jim Lipscomb,
				who was a graduate student before me at UNC, 
				<a href="http://wlipscomb.tripod.com/wnl_life.html">describes the traits 
				that enabled his father, William Lipscomb, to win a Nobel Prize.</a>
				However, I chose a different set of priorities and have not regretted
				that choice.  Decide for yourself what is most important in your life.</p>

				<p>Ideally, the job hunt begins years before you graduate. Networking is
				very important: while you are in the middle to late phases of your graduate
				studies, try to get yourself noticed by professors and industry people
				<em>at other sites</em>. One way to do this is to offer to give a talk about 
				your work at another site. This is not that difficult to do, since most research
				places love to host seminars and bring in fresh ideas. Attending conferences
				and working elsewhere during the summer are other ways to get exposure.
				Make friends with graduate students and personnel at other schools. Make
				and carry your own business cards. Schmooze with important visitors during
				major site visits. For about two years, I ran the informal “Graphics 
				Lunch” symposia at UNC. That means I was the point of contact for many 
				speakers who visited UNC and that helped me make contacts. There is also a 
				“star” system that exists. Certain outstanding graduate students 
				can get labeled as “stars” by their professors and that can be 
				an enormous help in getting an interview at CMU or other prestigious 
				locations. It’s nice if you can get on that track but one shouldn’t 
				rely upon it!</p>
				
				<p>Networking is important because many jobs are found and filled that
				way. I got my position at<a href="http://www.hrl.com/"> HRL</a> partially
				because I visited there, at my own expense, two years before I even started
				my job hunt. That meant that when I circulated my résumé,
				I was more than just a piece of paper to them. You’ll look for job
				announcements in major journals, at conferences, online, and through your 
				contacts.</p>
				
				<p>In most companies, the hiring authority resides with the manager who 
				owns the job position, not with the Human Resources department.  HR can
				reject a candidate, but they cannot hire a candidate.  As a hiring manager,
				my job is to only talk directly to candidates who are best qualified for
				the position.  As a candidate, your job is to <em>find the individual with 
				the ability to hire</em> and deal with that person directly, rather than 
				solely with the HR department.</p>

				<p>When do you start asking for interviews? You can start when you are
				able to give a talk about your dissertation work. Don’t be too early or
				too late, because you only get one chance per site. Academic positions
				generally have a particular “season” (much like getting admitted 
				to school) that starts in the Fall and ends around April; industrial positions 
				generally don’t follow that. The job hunt and interviewing process can 
				take months; factor that into your time allocation.</p>
				
				<p>The job supply and demand situation can vary dramatically in a few years,
				and anything I say here about the job market today will likely be out of date 
				by the time you read this. For example, during the time I was initially job 
				hunting (end of 1994 to early 1995), good positions were not easy to find. 
				If I had a dollar for every site that told me “We don’t have a 
				permanent position, but would you take a postdoc?” I could
				buy a lot of lunches. However, around 1997 the graphics job market became
				very strong, with many individuals getting multiple offers with high salaries.
				1998 was an excellent year for people looking for tenure-track graphics
				faculty positions. I know many friends who found good tenure-track positions
				that year. So when I revised this guide in 2000, I said the job market
				was strong with high demand. Of course, the tech industry went downhill
				at that point.  So I no longer say anything about how strong or weak the
				job market appears to be.</p>

				<p>Instead, I will describe two consistent but unfortunate trends I have 
				observed since graduating:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><em>Tenure-track positions are increasingly requiring candidates to
					do one or more postdocs:</em>  This trend has been documented by
					<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anita_K._Jones">Anita Jones</a>
					in the article 
					<a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2408801">The Explosive
					Growth of Postdocs in Computer Science (ACM Digital Library subscription
					required)</a>.  Since 2007, hiring of Ph.D.’s in
					academia is increasingly dominated by postdoc positions rather than
					tenure-track positions.  The requirements for a tenure-track position
					appear to have been redefined to make one or more postdocs nearly 
					mandatory.  This has been the case in other disciplines for a long
					time, but it is relatively new for Computer Science.  This delays a 
					Ph.D.’s career and forces people who want to become professors to 
					endure several more years of low pay and status.</li>

					<li><em>Industrial research positions have become difficult to find:</em>
					Overall, most businesses focus on the short term.  Therefore, the trend
					has been to cut back or close industrial research labs.  Big companies
					increasingly rely on letting startups attempt certain kinds of
					innovation and then partnering with or acquiring those.  Companies also
					pursue innovation through advanced development groups that are
					different than traditional research labs.
					</li>
				</ul>
			
				<p>Before starting the job hunt, determine your goals and parameters in
				advance and the “angle” you will take to sell yourself. For 
				example, my strength was in systems, so I chose to emphasize that in my 
				cover letters. Customize your approach to each site, if time permits. 
				What you do for your thesis determines who will and who won’t take 
				a look at you. Try to get at least one reference from outside your university.</p>
				
				<p>This guide is not going to cover the basics of interviewing; you can
				get that from many books (e.g. the Martin Yate and Bob Weinstein books
				listed in the references). However, I will mention some tips. Don’t 
				interview on the day of arrival, and try to avoid Mondays and Fridays. 
				Be prepared for hard or illegal questions, by finding polite ways of 
				addressing the underlying concern. <b>Do your homework</b> on each site 
				before interviewing! It continually amazes me that people show up for 
				interviews without knowing anything about the institution they want to 
				join. If the target is a research lab for a major company, you can easily 
				look up Wall St. Journal articles, annual reports and stockbroker reports. 
				If your goal is an academic position, check out the 
				<a href="http://cgi.stanford.edu/~dept-ctl/tomprof/postings.php">
				Tomorrow’s Professor site</a> and 
				<a href="http://theprofessorisin.com/">The Professor Is In</a>
				for guidance. If you interview at a 
				university, get their course catalog and <em>use their numbering scheme to 
				describe the courses you can teach</em>. Interview to find out more about 
				them, not just to sell yourself. Your 45-60 minute research presentation 
				is crucial; make sure you practice it thoroughly. <em>Interviews create 
				interviews</em>.  That is, if you’ve already gone on many interviews at 
				other places, that makes you appear more desirable since others want you, 
				and that makes it easier for you to get more interviews. Broadcast this 
				fact by keeping your interview schedule on your web page. There is an 
				anecdote about one student who received offers to interview at many 
				different places, but only after Stanford interviewed him! Keep logs on 
				who you talk to, what you talked about, and when. That makes it easier to 
				keep things straight when juggling several contenders. The major 
				conferences in your field are a good place to schedule preliminary 
				interviews to get your foot in the door, because it is cheap for the 
				company or university. The people you need to meet are already there, so 
				that saves them the expense of having to fly you out and house you at 
				their site.</p>
				
				<p>Offers are a waiting game. Be prepared for lots of frustration. You
				need a <em>written</em> offer or nothing is official; you should also accept
				or reject in writing. Negotiate, but be aware of the strength or weakness
				of your position.  I also recommend doing only one round of negotiating
				(i.e. you counterpropose terms, and the organization responds to that,
				and then you make a decision).  As a hiring manager, I can tell you that
				it is very frustrating when a candidate attempts to negotiate for a long
				time, and that can make an employer upset and possibly even rescind the 
				offer.  Look at the entire package.  Starting salary may not be as important 
				as the type of work, the environment, benefits, growth potential, and work-life
				balance. Drug tests and other factors are becoming more common; you will 
				have to decide how you want to respond to those.</p>
				
				<p>Ah yes, salaries. Everybody wants to know about those. For academic
				(tenure track) salaries, you can get typical numbers from the 
				<a href="http://cra.org/resources/taulbee/">annual Taulbee surveys</a>, 
				printed in the Computing Research News newsletter and the Communications
				of the ACM. For example, the median salary listed in the 2015 
				Taulbee survey for associate professors was almost $114k.
				Realize that these are 9-month salaries. Whether or not you
				can procure funding to cover 2 or 3 months of summer salary makes a
				big difference to your bottom line. Also, professors can make money by
				consulting, although this is more common among established professors. 
				Rates can be up to $4000 per day or more, depending on the type of 
				consulting and the client. Figures for industrial salaries are harder
				to come by. The Maisel and Gaddy references are the only ones I have found
				that specifically survey young Ph.D.’s in industry, and those figures are
				now very old. Salaries depend heavily on geography. For example, salaries
				in the Silicon Valley and San Francisco are high.  But
				before you decide to move to Palo Alto, remember that the cost of living
				there is also in the stratosphere. When I first wrote this guide (in 1997),
				nice houses in the Silicon Valley in good areas cost more than half a million
				dollars.  In 2017, those same houses probably cost $1.25M to $1.5M or more.  
				More general computer science salary surveys 
				are run by the IEEE and <a href="http://www.eetimes.com/">EE Times</a>.</p>
				
				<p>As a hiring manager, I will caution you against believing self-reported 
				figures from sites such as Glassdoor.  My experience is that those are
				not accurate and generally exaggerate salary figures.  They also often 
				confuse base salaries with total compensation that includes bonuses,
				stock and other benefits.</p>
				
				<p>Acquire salary information on your own by making use of your network.
				Don’t ask for someone’s salary directly, unless it’s 
				someone you know very well and even then be very careful. Instead, bounce 
				figures off people and see how they respond. Do they think the figure you 
				mention is high, low, or about right? By seeing how people respond you can 
				get an idea of what the market range is.</p>
				
				<p>Factor in benefits and the expected workload into your compensation
				evaluation. An offer with high compensation may seem less attractive if you 
				have to work 80 hour weeks in that position. You may have to do some detective
				work to determine the truth.  A company might say they value work-life balance, 
				while the established culture tells you a different story:
				where people have to work 80 hour weeks to get promoted or to even keep up
				with expectations and deadlines.  For many positions, particularly
				in Silicon Valley, variable compensation (cash bonuses, 
				<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restricted_stock">restricted stock units</a>
				and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employee_stock_option">stock options</a>)
				make up a significant part of the total compensation, along with benefits.</p>

				<p>For Computer Science Ph.D.’s, there are four major categories of 
				employers:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Startups (including starting your own business or consulting)</li>
					<li>Commercial businesses</li>
					<li>Industrial or government research labs</li>
					<li>Academia</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p><b><em>Startups:</em></b> Joining a startup, or starting your own company,
				is potentially the most lucrative route.  It is also the riskiest.
				Most startups pay below market compensation and cannot offer the benefits
				that Google can, but may offer equity that provides the chance of a 
				“home run” that you won’t get at a big company.
				Most startups fail. 
				Overall, the home runs are few, but they do occur.  For example, I 
				know some people who joined Oculus prior to it being acquired by Facebook.
				Startups are a very different work environment than established big
				companies.  They are typically small, informal, agile, and lacking
				in resources.  They may be more flexible in work environment than
				most Fortune 500 companies.  But they are also less likely to have
				knowledgable HR personnel who ensure that laws are followed.
				A paycheck from a Fortune 500 company is not likely to bounce.  Startups
				tend to fire quickly and are more likely to shut down. </p>

				<p>A startup has a limited amount of time and resources to establish
				itself so that it can become self sustaining or an acquisition target.  
				That means it is not a place to pursue long-term research, no matter 
				what the founders may say.  The best analogy I heard: Joining a startup
				is like deciding to jump off a tall cliff with a bunch of other 
				people, believing that you will successfully build working sets of
				wings and will soar away prior to hitting the ground.  If you do this,
				you don’t want to spend time and energy on things that aren’t
				directly related to building wings!  You might also check the base of
				the cliff beforehand to see how many bodies you find there. </p>

				<p>Startups are not generally compatible with work-life balance.  
				Due to the limited resources, startups have to demand more sacrifices
				than a more established company.</p>

				<p>By working in a startup, you will likely fall out of touch with
				the research community in your field and lose the state-of-the-art
				knowledge that you worked so hard to acquire by getting a Ph.D.  It
				is easier to go from a research background to a startup or commercial
				position than it is to go the other direction.</p>

				<p>Although old, the Kawasaki and Bell references listed at the end
				of this document may be useful if you want to work at a startup.</p>

				<p><a href="http://mattcutts.com/blog/">Matt Cutts</a> was a graduate
				student at UNC Chapel Hill.  We both had the same advisor.  Unlike me, Matt 
				did not finish his Ph.D.  Instead, he left early to join a startup 
				that had less than 100 people at that time. You might have heard of this 
				startup.  It was called Google.</p>

				<p>If you win the startup lottery, like Matt, he offers some advice
				<a href="http://mattcutts.com/blog/investing-reading-list/">here</a>
				and <a href="https://www.mattcutts.com/blog/make-money-investing-tips/">here</a>.
				I also like how 
				<a href="http://www.modernluxury.com/san-francisco/story/the-best-investment-advice-youll-never-get">

				<p>For two different perspectives of startups, read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Disrupted-My-Misadventure-Start-Up-Bubble/dp/0316306088/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1486345803&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=disrupted+my+misadventure+in+the+start-up+bubble">

				The Founder’s Dilemmas</a>, which explains challenges and key
				decisions that founders face in starting their own company.</p>

				<p><b><em>Commercial businesses:</em></b> Normal development or production jobs 
				that focus on supporting or developing new products represent the vast majority 
				of employment opportunities.  However, getting a Ph.D. makes you overqualified
				for most of these.  Ph.D. training prepares students for academic careers,
				rather than business careers.  Most people who seek a Ph.D. are looking
				for different types of work than normal commercial jobs.  However, if your
				interests lie in business rather than research, this can be the best way
				to go.  There are Ph.D’s who have become VP’s and CEO’s.
				Advanced development jobs can be interesting and challenging, and they provide
				the satisfaction of seeing your work impact product or a company.</p>

				<p><b><em>Industrial or government research labs:</em></b> These sit somewhere
				in between normal commercial jobs and academia.  Typically they enable
				you to look somewhat longer term than a normal job, publish papers,
				go to conferences, etc.  However, these are managed environments, so
				your research work must tie into the business of the company or the
				mission of the lab.  Reorganizations and changes in priorities can 
				commonly occur, and you have to surf those changes to stay employed
				and viable.  The compensation in industrial research can be good, generally
				much better than government positions or academia.  But like commercial
				jobs or startups, your job can get cut at any time.  I worked at a lab 
				where one day, without any warning, managers appeared and informed us that
				the company was shutting down our lab and that almost everyone would be
				laid off, including me.  You also will not have the “home run” 
				potential of a startup.</p>

				<p>If you work in industrial research, you should really be motivated to
				make an impact on your company, by transitioning research into product 
				or processes that directly contribute to your company’s future.
				If your primary goals are to publish papers, advance the field and make
				a name for yourself, and you don’t really care about the commercial
				and business aspects, then academia is a better choice.  However, even
				if you focus on doing research that is important to your company, it is
				possible to achieve external recognition.  For example, I recently
				was elected an 
				<a href="http://www.ieee.org/membership_services/membership/fellows/index.html">
				IEEE Fellow</a>, despite spending my entire career in
				industrial research.  In this role, you should be ambitious to 
				accomplish something rather than being ambitious to make yourself
				famous.</p>

				<p>Labs that are completely owned by commercial companies or ones that
				have mandated government funding generally have a consistent stream of
				funding (until executives or politicians decide to change things).  Other 
				labs must rely on winning contracts, from other companies or from the 
				government.  That can be a volatile, frustrating way to work.  It can be 
				stressful knowing that your team’s continued employment depends on 
				winning the next contract.  In a previous job, I sometimes felt we spent
				100% of our time trying to secure funding, so we could spend the other
				100% getting some research done.</p>

				<p><b><em>Academia:</em></b> Working in universities is the traditional career
				path for Ph.D.’s.  A tenured professor is the most secure and stable
				research position that exists, and the one that grants the most freedom.  
				Professors can choose what they want to work on.  If you are focused on publishing
				and want to ensure that nobody can tell you what to do, then become a
				tenured professor.  If your main motivation is to become a very
				famous researcher, then become a tenured professor.</p>

				<p>However, tenure is not easy to achieve.  Getting a tenure-track
				position is difficult.  You have to be good and possibly lucky to get
				one.  As I previously mentioned, postdoc experience is becoming an almost 
				mandatory prerequisite.  Read the Feibelman and Ralston references
				for tips on surviving a postdoc.  Furthermore, getting tenure is a race
				against the clock to publish enough impressive research results that your
				department decides to grant tenure rather than sending you out the door.
				As Randy Pausch put it, tenure is a competitive
				process where you get compared with the other assistant professors and
				the already-tenured professors. If they worked 70 hour weeks for six years
				to get tenure, don’t expect to get away with working 40 hour weeks.</p>

				<p>The tenure track is not kind to those who want to start a family.  Even if
				you start graduate school directly after finishing your Bachelor’s
				degree, you will probably be in your late 20’s when finishing the Ph.D.
				and in your mid to late 30’s when achieving tenure.  
				<a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/motherhood-not-discrimination-gender-gap-tenure-science-jobs/">
				The realities of the biological clock tend to conflict with the demands required to
				achieve tenure.</a></p>

				<p>Professor jobs tend to be focused either on research or teaching.  
				Smaller colleges and universities tend to focus mostly on teaching, and
				professors are evaluated that way.  Teaching positions generally pay less than
				the research positions at big universities, where professors are primarily 
				evaluated by their research and how many trees they kill by publishing 
				papers, and if their
				teaching is good enough to keep the dean from hearing complaints.</p>

				<p>There are also “soft money” positions in academia, which 
				are professors and staff who are paid from contracts and grants rather 
				than tenured positions.  These lack the security of tenure and it can be
				difficult to stay alive on such funding.  Most contracts and grants are
				aimed at funding graduate students and covering one or two months of a 
				professor’s salary, but not toward paying for full-time staff.</p>

				<p>The comments I made about fundraising in industrial or government
				research labs also apply to academic positions.  Most of my friends who
				are professors in the US have to spend far too much time writing proposals,
				and the percentage of those that are awarded seems to keep going down.
				If you are tenured, then your job does not rely upon winning proposals,
				but without external money, you will not be able to support graduate
				students or pay for extra staff, and your impact will therefore be
				limited.</p>

				<p>I saw a Computing Research News article estimating that total compensation 
				for assistant and associate professors lags that of industrial 
				counterparts by 25%.  Compared against Silicon Valley compensation, I 
				estimate the difference to be around 50%.</p>
				
				<p>If you want to get a tenure-track position, read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Professor-Essential-Guide-Turning-Ph-D/dp/0553419420/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1462665057&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+professor+is+in">
				The Professor Is In</a>, a book that goes into great detail about
				how to land a tenure-track job.  The author also runs a 
				<a href="http://theprofessorisin.com/">blog and service</a>
				to help students seeking to become professors.  Keep in mind that
				the author has a background in the humanities, so if you are a
				CS Ph.D. student you have to factor in the differences between a CS Ph.D.
				program vs. one in the humanities.
				For example, CS Ph.D. students typically receive financial 
				support, so accumulating large debts is less of a problem.  
				In CS, publications at
				certain conferences are valuable, whereas in the humanities,
				conference publications may not count for much.</p>

				<p><b><em>Other tips:</em></b> When I had to look for a job in 2012, 
				the single thing I did that was most helpful to my job hunt was 
				<a href="http://ronaldazuma.com/">creating my own website</a>.
				A C.V. is a very dry, hard to read document.  My website serves as a visual
				version of a C.V. where I provide images, videos, and detailed 
				descriptions of the projects I worked on.  This is a much more compelling 
				way of communicating who I am and what I can offer.  As a hiring manager,
				I found it very helpful when candidates had good websites about themselves.
				LinkedIn is sufficient for many job hunters, but for people with a Ph.D.,
				I highly recommend creating and maintaining your own website.  It doesn’t
				cost that much and is well worth the effort.</p>

				<p>No matter where you go after you graduate, maintain your contacts with
				your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alma_mater"> alma mater</a>. 
				You may change jobs and move from place to place, but
				you will always have your degree from your university. If you keep good
				relations with your university and your fellow former students, that will
				serve as an excellent base for your personal network.</p>

			<div class="contentText">
				<p>To me, there are two lessons in this story.</p>
				
				<p>First, the Ph.D. is the beginning, not the culmination, of your career.
				Don’t worry about making it your 
				<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnum_opus">magnum opus</a>.
				Get out sooner, rather than later.</p>

				<p>Second, if you bother to talk to and learn from the people who have
				already gone through this process, you might graduate two years earlier.</p>
				
				<p>Good luck.</p>
