# Assorted Finance Tips

Keeping with my tradition of compiling together random finance conepts that college- and post-college students should somewhat learn about, I'm dropping this list here. I'll likely move it later, but this is a good finance/econ temp spot for my random musings. The internet suggests "behave like the rich to get rich." That applies to managing an asset portfolio, not flaundering your wealth. This is not financial advice, but a small list of topics I've learned over time. Do your research.
* DSCR Loan
* 529 Exchange (college savings accounts)
* 1031 Exchange (real estate)
* HSA triple tax advantage
* $250k/500k home tax exclusion
* Supplementary leverage ratio
* When is Direct Indexing worth it? (see [[Youtube short](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/TdEO6oqo6r4){:target="_blank"}]
* Risk management through position sizing
* Rebalance your portfolio quarterly (or on some other schedule)
* Accredited investor rules (there are more select criteria above this, such as rules that apply only if you have a >$250M portfolio size)
* Rollover IRA. Backdoor Roth IRA.
* Watch your worst case. For example, for a loan your decision thresholds could be: 95% likelihood of losing no more than 25% of the investment borrowed, and 100% likelihood of losing no more than 50%. Thus even if you estimate the probabilities wrong, you know your maximal opportunity cost against the baseline (which is often doing nothing).
