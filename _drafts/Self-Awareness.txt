Office hours are 9am to 5pm. Intuitively it makes sense: it's 1/3 of the day that employees exchange to advance the company's bottom-line, it's a decent trade-off for employees between work and evening life, and employees are likely to be most-productive at *some points* during that period. That's the old model, at least, where employees must clock-in to the office and be seen working for all 8 hours, whether they actually are working or not. Once in the office, employers encourage productivity through extrinsic motivators such as positive incentives or negative surveillance (although some economic research has shown these policies may [backfire](https://lorko.sk/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Gneezy2000.pdf) or yield [undesirable consequences](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0007681317301611)). 

It's hard enough to measure someone's performance over time, much less their overall marginal contribution to a completed project. employers have tried countless means of [incentivizing]() or surveilling their employees to work harder, often to [counterproductive results]().

PRODUCTIVITY = CREATIVE EFFORT / TASK DIFFICULTY.
EVEN IF YOU ARE INTRINSICALLY MOTIVATED -- IF THE PAYOFF CHART IS ONLY WORTHWHILE IF YOU SUCCEED, EG AS AN ENTREPRENEUR. THE PROJECT LIVES OR DIES BY HOW MUCH HE WORKS.
EASY TASKS (EG CHOPPING WOOD, WHICH IS LINEAR IN TIME AND SIZE OF TREE) VS HARD TASKS (EG SOLVING A PHD-LEVEL PROBLEM)
IF YOU CAN ONLY WORK CERTAIN HOURS OF THE DAY AND MUST SIT IN ONE SPOT, YOU'RE PERFORMING CONSTRAINED OPTIMIZATION OVER YOURSELF.
IF YOU HAVE FULL FLEXIBILITY ABOUT WHEN, WHERE, AND HOW YOU WORK, THEN THAT GIVES THE MOST FREEDOM AND RANGE TO OPTIMIZE. HOWEVER, WITH THAT FREEDOM AND LACK OF EXTERNAL COMMITTMENT, YOU'RE MORE LIKELY TO SLACK OFF. YOU NEED THAT DISCIPLINE TO SUCCEED.
HOW AWAKE YOU ARE -- IS A CONTROL SYSTEM. YOU CAN'T DECIDE TO BE AWAKE ALL THE TIME, BUT YOU CAN DO THINGS THAT TEND TO INCREASE YOUR AWAKENESS: GET ENOUGH SLEEP CONSISTENTLY, WORK OUT, DRINK ENOUGH BUT NOT TOO MUCH COFFEE, SOCIALIZE.
VERTICAL TIME -- FOCUSING ON ONE PROJECT, TODAY.
HORIZONTAL TIME -- ENABLING YOUR WORK TO COMPOUND: (1) YOUR BRAIN GETS TIME TO RECHARGE AND MULL IT OVER IN YOUR UNCONSCIOUS, (2) EACH NEW TIME YOU SEE THE PROBLEM, YOU'VE HAD MORE LIFE EXPERIENCE SINCE THE LAST TIME AND YOU SEE THE PROBLEM DIFFERENTLY, (3) EACH FAILURE AND NEW ATTEMPT MEANS THAT YOU MOVE BEYOND WHAT DOESN'T WORK AND YOU CAN USE THE LESSONS OF THAT FAILURE TO IMPROVE GOING FORWARD, (4) YOU CAN STOP THINKING ABOUT WHAT YOU'VE ALREADY BUILT (EG WRITTEN ON YOUR ESSAY) AND CAN MOVE FORWARD WITH WHAT'S NEXT -- IT TAKES TIME TO DISCARD THIS.
MANY ASPECTS OF LIFE ARE A CONTROL PROBLEM. YOUR BRAIN CAN MAKE DECISIONS BUT IT'S HARD (UNLESS YOU'RE A MONK) TO DECIDE TO BE IN A CERTAIN EMOTIONAL STATE -- OR ABILITY TO THINK CLEARLY STATE. GOOD FOOD IN A COMFORTABLE ENVIRONMENT MAKES YOU CALM. COFFEE MAKES YOU AWAKE FOR 4 HOURS AND THEN STARTS TO MAKE YOU DROWZY (BUT NOT ALL OF IT HAS LEFT YOUR SYSTEM YET). BEING SENSUAL WITH A LOVER MAKES YOU HORNY. SKYDIVING MAKES YOU EXHILERATED. SPENDING TIME ONLINE SCATTERS YOUR BRAIN -- EVEN THOUGH WE LIKE TO HAVE OUR PHONES WITHIN REACH TO ENABLE THE TEMPTATION OF BEING ONLINE. ADVERTISEMENTS AND LOUD DEROGATORY MUSIC SCATTER THE BRAIN. 
HM, DO VIOLENT VIDEO GAMES ENCOURAGE VIOLENCE IN YOUNG TEENS? IS THAT AN APPROPRIATE CORRECT QUESTION I'M MAKING THIS COMPARISON FOR?
EG WHEN YOU FINISH A HARD PROJECT AND LOSSEN YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES, YOU CAN FEEL THE OPENNESS IN YOUR BRAIN THAT LEAVES ROOM FOR CREATIVITY AND NEW IDEAS TO FLOURISH.

CENSORSHIP, ROWANDA, WHO GETS TO DECIDE WHAT THE LINE IS? PASS THROUGH LEGAL.

NEUROCHEMISTRY QUESTION -- WHAT CAUSES CERTAIN RECURRING STIMULUS TO PASS THROUGH THE BRAIN? EG PHONE ADDICTION. I FEEL LIKE I HAVEN'T CHECKED MY PHONE SO I GO TO SEE IT ASAP. BUT THAT FEELING CAN FADE AFTER AWHILE OR IF I TAKE A REGIMENT (EG STOP FEEDING THAT ADDICTION OR GO CAMPING AND REMOVE THE POSSIBILITY).
