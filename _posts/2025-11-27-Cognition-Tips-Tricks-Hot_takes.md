A list of hot takes about cognition and learning.

* Not every hour is created equal. Brain effectiveness fluctuates throughout the day and week.
* You can read page 6 and find it gibberish. But reading through, carefully, unpacks the mystery of what is being communicated. Life plays these tricks on you: understanding something's meaning takes care, time, and effort.
* Watching a 1 minute Youtube short the second time "feels" faster than the first time around.
* Learning is an active process, and every class is an opportunity to learn something. For a 60 minute class, you can be outside the classroom or inside it listening to the speaker – the 60 minutes is going to pass by anyways, it’s up to you to actively participate in the material and fit it into your conceptual understanding of a topic.<!--more-->
* If you take a break on a project (e.g., restarting it the next day), you may have to spend some time to **re-cache** to remind your short-term/active/working memory of where you were in the problem solving process.
* Deadlines in school are artificial. In practice, timelines must be met for certain deliverables. For certain problems, it's better to take the perspective that you only get so many hours to solve a problem you care about, rather than you only have to work for so many hours.
* Judge yourself by your inputs, not the outputs. -- Alex Hormozi
* Saying to yourself "I'm going to remember it later" is a lie. Write it down, especially when you're about to fall asleep.
* Fancy apartments are facades, albeit niceties needed for human fostering. Functionally they're all the same.
* The people at your job are who you're going to become in 10 years by staying at that company.
* "What do you want to be" is a descriptive ask; "What do you want to do" is an active, planning one.
* Intentionality: recognize your tradeoffs and design your career strategically, just as you'd design your own college degree based on courses you find interesting, if you could.
* There's a difference in doing research based on: do you want to be the person who gets X done, do you want to take the credit for getting X done, or do you want someone else to do X so that you can do something else based on X's results? 
* If you forgot what you're about to say, try remembering the trajectory of your thought process. For instance, if you discussed topics X1, X2, and X3, then went on a tangent of Y1, remind yourself of the X-sequence to increase your chances of remembering X4.
* Fellowships are designed to support people doing what they want to do, not provide instructions.
* Cognitive heuristics for easier decision-making
  * Choose a default decision and then wait, pivot if you feel regret. That's easier than choosing between two similar options.
  * Trust your past and future selves to recognize missing information, in case you can't handle everything now. Thank your "later" and "former" "me."
  * Make a decision as though: in 5 min, what decision would you have already made? Hindsight is easier to reason about than the present.
* You work hard in school for the opportunity to be entrusted with work for pay, later in life.
* Jocko Willink suggests Extreme Ownership. Brian Tracy suggests "you're responsible for everything in your life." This means identifying the state of things how they are today, what you'd like them to be, and then creating a plan over the next 12 quarters on how to get there. Certain things, such as habits, addictions, relationships, skills, and cognitive patterns, take time and effort to change. Regardless, they are in your control to change. Joe Brown of Heresey Financial says: even if it's not your fault, it is your problem.
