[In Time](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1637688/) is a 2011 science-fiction film, starring Justin Timberlake and Amanda Seyfried, with a fascinating economic system. The underlying premise is that people only live as long as the amount of time left on their personal clock, which serves as a material manifestation of individual wealth. Rather than exchange fiat or commodity-backed currency, people trade time. Hence, people are segregated into socio-economic districts. The elite can live forever while the poor die early in their ghettos. (I don't recall where the time comes from, as the total amount of time in the system clearly deteriorates at a rate proportional to the number of people.)

At first glance, this system does seem similar to wage labor in the United States. Rather than working for time, as in the movie, people exchange a fixed amount of time for a fixed amount of USD (e.g., 50 hour per week for $60,000 annually as a [high school teacher](https://money.usnews.com/careers/best-jobs/high-school-teacher/salary)). In both cases, wages buy people their necessities. When someone hit zero in your bank account, they would die of starvation if it weren't for loans and safety nets such as charity, unemployment benefits, and federal [bankruptcy law](https://www.uscourts.gov/services-forms/bankruptcy/bankruptcy-basics). Interestingly, for most wage laborers, money equals time.

One major difference is that in the US, people have *some* agency on how they spend their money to eliminate costs as much as possible, whereas in the movie everyone is forced to spends their currency by at least the same amount each day. In the US each dollar loses its value at an official inflation rate between 0% and 5% each year [since the 1980s](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/inflation-cpi).
