# RQ1: Case Study in the ethical foundations of societal impacts
In consumer marketing, there's a positive relationship between advertising exposure and purchasing behavior, dampened by personal consumption susceptibility factors. We can conceivably find data to support that increased advertising exposure causes increased debt load **(TODO: Source)**. Minimum ethical considerations of Freedom of Choice are justified, notably in:
* (1) option to be exposed to advertising is available to the consumer, since they are going out in public or choosing to activate a device with ads;
* (2) advertisers paying a platform to place their advert is legal and fair;
* (3) consumers have the freedom of choice for purchasing advertised products and services or not.
Despite these ethical microfoundations being justified, increased advertising is (reasonably) causing increased consumer debt load, which affects households' long-term outcomes. The RQ is whether it is ethical to prohibit over-saturation of advertising in public, where the saturation limit is the empirical optimal amount of advertising relative to advert costs and consumer acquisition. If so, how is this regulation justified? Note that this case study is similar to BNPL.
