A list of hot takes about cognition and learning.

* Not every hour is created equal. Brain effectiveness fluctuates throughout the day and week.
* You can read page 6 and find it gibberish. But reading through, carefully, unpacks the mystery of what is being communicated. Life plays these tricks on you: understanding something's meaning takes care, time, effort, and love.
* Watching a 1 minute Youtube short the second time "feels" faster than the first time around.
* Learning is an active process, and every class is an opportunity to learn something. For a 60 minute class, you can be outside the classroom or inside it listening to the speaker – the 60 minutes is going to pass by anyways, it’s up to you to actively participate in the material and fit it into your conceptual understanding of a topic.<!--more-->
* If you take a break on a project (e.g., restarting it the next day), you may have to spend some time to **re-cache** to remind your short-term/active/working memory of where you were in the problem solving process.
* Deadlines in school are artificial. In practice, timelines must be met for certain deliverables. For certain problems, it's better to take the perspective that you only get so many hours to solve a problem you care about, rather than you only have to work for so many hours.
* Judge your inputs, not the outputs.
* Saying to yourself "I'm going to remember it later" is a lie. Write it down, especially when you're about to fall asleep.
* Fancy apartments are facades, albeit niceties needed for human fostering. Functionally they're all the same.
* The people at your job are who you're going to become in 10 years by staying at that company.
* "What do you want to be" is a descriptive ask; "to do" is an active planning one
* Intentionality: recognize your tradeoffs and design your career strategically, just as you'd design your own college degree based on courses you find interesting, if you could.
