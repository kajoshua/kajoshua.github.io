Welcome! This blog is to provide a space for me to share assorted knowledge I've synthesized, books I've reviewed, and concepts I've thought about. I expect it to be an evolving space -- not strictly related to my research -- and one that will hopefully be more interactive in time. Enjoy!


### Who Am I?

I am a senior data scientist at C3.AI. Previously, I worked at the RAND Corporation after completing my PhD in artificial intelligence at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. I am interested in formal methods of decision making: inter-dependent, strategic, and under uncertainty -- leading me to research *computational social choice*, *multiagent systems*, and *reinforcement learning*. 

Check out my professional website [here](http://kajoshua.github.io/)!

Personally: I am a lindy hop dancer, hiker, musician, reader, and photographer. I also have some interest in political economy, political philosophy, environmentalism, sustainability, epistemology, and world religions.
