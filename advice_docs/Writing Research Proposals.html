  <p align="left" class="body">All good research proposals, whether they're for 
    an undergraduate Directed Studies project, a graduate thesis or term project, 
    or to a granting agency for millions of dollars of research funds; and whether 
    they represent work of an individual or of a large team, have some characteristics 
    in common. Here are some tips on what I want to see in any research proposal 
    that I am asked to evaluate.</p>
  <p align="left" class="body"><b>1. Background</b></p>
</div>
<ul>
  <li> 
    <div align="left"><span class="body"><b>Motivation</b>: what is the basic 
      problem which your research is going to address? I.e., why should anyone 
      care about what you are proposing to do?<br>
      <br>
      </span></div>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <div align="left"><span class="body"><b>Progress</b>: what has already been 
      done that relates to solving this problem? I.e., what will be your starting 
      point? Sometimes it seems like you are working in a brand new area and there 
      isn't any prior work. That is never true: even if your implementation relies 
      on an entirely new technology, or you are using some method for an entirely 
      new purpose, somewhere someone will have tried to solve that problem using 
      a different approach, or used some variant of your technology in a different 
      way, etc. Find what's closest and talk about it, even if its relevance seems 
      quite distant to what you plan to do. Saying &quot;there is no prior work&quot; 
      will seriously damage your credibility, since it just makes it sounds like 
      you aren't very familiar with the field.<br>
      <br>
      Conversely, in some contexts, it isn't really expected that you are deeply 
      familiar with the area, or will have had time to do a thorough review. Do 
      the best you can, even if it's only asking the nearest expert at hand for 
      a few relevant references and taking a look at them before writing the proposal.</span></div>
  </li>
</ul>
<div align="right"> 
  <p align="left" class="body"><span class="body"><b>2. Goals</b></span></p>
</div>
<ul>
  <li> 
    <div align="left"><span class="body"><b>Anticipated contribution</b>: what 
      will exist or be known when you're done? There may be more than one thing.<br>
      <br>
      Remember, this is research, so you don't know for <i>sure</i> what you'll 
      accomplish. However, you hopefully can state that you are going to ask some 
      kind of question and find the answer to it. The whole point is that you 
      don't know what that answer is; but if the question is well-posed, then 
      even if the answer is not what you were hoping for, then you will have learned 
      something in the process and not wasted your time.</span></div>
  </li>
</ul>
<div align="right"> 
  <p align="left" class="body"><span class="body"><b>3. Milestones: what are the 
    steps to get from Prior Work to your Goal? </b><br>
    </span></p>
</div>
<ul>
  <li> 
    <div align="left"><span class="body"><b>Break down your task</b> into a manageable 
      number of steps, to be executed either serially or in parallel. 4-5 is often 
      a reasonable number for a proposal - later as you do the work, you may further 
      break down those steps into sub-tasks for yourself. For each task, identify 
      a &quot;deliverable&quot; or question-point, where you will (a) know that 
      you've finished that task, and/or (b) will be able to make some decision 
      that influences the way the work will proceed from that point.<br>
      <br>
      </span></div>
  </li>
  <li><span class="body"><b>Dependencies:</b> for each task, take into account 
    activities, resources, necessary learning, and in particuluar, events or contributions 
    outside of your control which your successful progress will depend on. This 
    last might include things like arrival or completion of a piece of equipment 
    or software that someone else is building, or time contributed by someone 
    with a special expertise. <br>
    <br>
    </span></li>
  <li><span class="body"><b>Schedule:</b> how long will each step take? Put down 
    expected duration and a date for when you expect to reach the milestone. This 
    is where you get to prac the fine art of time estimation. Believe me, you 
    will probably not allow enough time, even if you write down twice as much 
    time as you think the step could possibly take. Sometimes it helps to further 
    break down the task at this point, and if you're confident about the completeness 
    of the list of subtasks, you may be able to estimate them with better accuracy. 
    With practice (i.e. doing the job then comparing your actual performance with 
    predicted) you'll eventually get a little better at estimating how long it 
    takes you to do different kinds of things, and consequently you'll get better 
    at planning although you should accept that most mortals never reach perfection 
    in this. <br>
    <br>
    Allow extra time for tasks which are unfamiliar to you, and tasks which may 
    require iteration; and consider dependencies which might interfere with your 
    schedule. </span></li>
</ul>
<div align="right"> 
  <p align="left" class="body"><span class="body"><b>4. Screw Points: </b>milestones 
    where if you cannot complete them successfully or on time, then you are screwed.</span></p>
</div>
<ul>
  <li> 
    <div align="left"><span class="body">There is probably a more polite term 
      for this: look for places where a bad result will mean that there is no 
      point in continuing because you are not going to learn or accomplish anything 
      of value. It's really important to take this into account personally even 
      if it's not included in your proposal: suppose it is your Ph.D. thesis and 
      you find yourself in this unfortunate position after working on a problem 
      for several years? If the proposal is to me, it should be in there.<br>
      <br>
      </span></div>
  </li>
  <li><span class="body">What will be your backup plan in each case? Is there 
    an alternate, perhaps less desirable but still acceptable path that will lead 
    to some result other than absolute failure? If not, and the failure has any 
    real liklihood of occurring, then this is a seriously flawed research plan.</span></li>
