title: Sixth-grade Science Experiments

A short list of cool science experiments, projects, and questions for middle-schoolers.


## (1) Refraction of Light

Place two objects in sequence behind a light source (e.g., the sun) so that their shadows are completely separate. You can observe that the shadow of the further object *grows* toward the shadow of the closer object as you align the objects so that the shadows intersect.

**Questions to ask:**
1. Why does this occur?
2. Does the rate at which light refracts depend on the intensity of the light source?

## (2) Bubbles

Why (i.e., How) do bubbles congregate? If one pops, the rest will rearrange themselves to be convex.
