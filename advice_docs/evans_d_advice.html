<h3>Life and College</h3>

Paul Graham's advice on what to do in college: <a
href="http://paulgraham.com/college.html"><em>Undergraduation</em></a>
<blockquote><em>
So the fact that you're mainly interested in hacking shouldn't deter you
from going to grad school. Just be warned you'll have to do a lot of
stuff you don't like.
<p>
Number one will be your dissertation. Almost everyone hates their
dissertation by the time they're done with it. The process inherently
tends to produce an unpleasant result, like a cake made out of whole
wheat flour and baked for twelve hours. Few dissertations are read with
pleasure, especially by their authors.
<p>
But thousands before you have suffered through writing a
dissertation. And aside from that, grad school is close to
paradise. Many people remember it as the happiest time of their
lives. And nearly all the rest, including me, remember it as a period
that would have been, if they hadn't had to write a dissertation.</em>

Scott Adams' <a href="http://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2007/07/career-advice.html">Career Advice</a>:
<blockquote>
<em>If you want an average successful life, it doesn't take much
planning. Just stay out of trouble, go to school, and apply for jobs you
might like. But if you want something extraordinary, you have two paths:

<ol>
<li> Become the best at one specific thing.
<li> Become very good (top 25%) at two or more things.
</ol>
</em>
<div class="rightnote">
I can't speak from personal experience about playing in the NBA (or at
anywhere approximating non-embarrasingly level in a pick-up basketball
game), but I think Scott is probably wrong here. If you think of "one
specific thing" as "playing basketball", he's right; but, playing
basketball is one specific thing any more than "doing science" is. If
you want to make the NBA, you either need to be the very best there is
at one specific thing (e.g., defense, shooting 3-pointers, play-making,
and above some threshold at everything else) or very good at two or more
of those things.
</div>
<em>
The first strategy is difficult to the point of near impossibility. Few
people will ever play in the NBA or make a platinum album. I don't
recommend anyone even try.

Randy Pausch's advice on achieving your childhood dreams: <a
href="mms://wms.andrew.cmu.edu/001/pausch.wmv">Windows Media Video
file</a>
<blockquote>
<em>Almost all of us have childhood dreams; for example, being an astronaut,
or making movies or video games for a living.  Sadly, most people don't
achieve theirs, and I think that's a shame.  I had several childhood
dreams, and I've actually achieved most of them.  More importantly, I
have found ways, in particular the creation (with Don Marinelli), of
CMU's Entertainment Technology Center of helping many young people
actually <b>achieve</b> their childhood dreams.
<p>
This talk will discuss how I achieved my childhood dreams (being in zero
gravity, designing theme park rides for Disney, and a few others), and
will contain realistic advice on how *you* can live your life so that
you can make your childhood dreams come true, too.

Steve Wozniak's <a

to a high school student</a>:
<blockquote>
<em>I also decided that I did not have to convince others of my views for
those views to be good. They only needed to be good to me. I didn't have
to argue and win points. Arguments rarely have 'winners' anyway. I could
tell what I believed (even how to make a computer) and if others didn't
agree, they were not bad. They just thought differently. I would have
the belief that my thoughts were good and were inside my head and that's
all that mattered.
...
The best things I did in my young years leading up to the early Apple
computers were done because I had little money and had to think deeply
to achieve the impossible. Also, I had never done those technologies or
studied them. I had to write the book myself. Being self-taught,
figuring out how to design computers with pencil and paper, made me
skilled at finding solutions that I had not been taught.</em>

      Every High School Junior Should Know About Going to
      College</em></a>
<blockquote>
<em>
Should you stop school after you graduate from high school, or continue
on to college?
</p><p>
Going to college definitely sounds better.  Almost every authority
figure in your life - educators and family alike - recommend it to each
and every student.  But as you may have noticed, authority figures are
often untrustworthy.  Indeed, they usually bend the truth whenever
honesty makes them look bad.  This doesn't mean you shouldn't go to
college, but it is a reason to second-guess the party line, to seek out
ugly facts parents and educators would rather ignore.

<blockquote>
<em>
<p>
We didn't ascend from our hunter-gatherer days by being
satisfied. People have a voracious appetite for a better way, and
yesterday's "wow" quickly becomes today's "ordinary". 
</p>
...
<p>
A close friend recently decided to learn to do a perfect free-standing
handstand. No leaning against a wall. Not for just a few
seconds. Instagram good. She decided to start her journey by taking a
handstand workshop at her yoga studio. She then practiced for a while
but wasn't getting the results she wanted. So, she hired a handstand
coach. Yes, I know what you're thinking, but evidently this is an actual
thing that exists. In the very first lesson, the coach gave her some
wonderful advice. "Most people," he said, "think that if they work hard,
they should be able to master a handstand in about two weeks. The
reality is that it takes about six months of daily practice. If you
think you should be able to do it in two weeks, you're just going to end
up quitting." Unrealistic beliefs on scope &mdash; often hidden and
undiscussed &mdash; kill high standards. To achieve high standards yourself or
as part of a team, you need to form and proactively communicate
realistic beliefs about how hard something is going to be &mdash; something
this coach understood well.

<h3>Research and Grad School</h3>

<p>
Claude Shannon's advice on
creativity: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190421034536/https://medium.com/the-mission/a-genius-explains-how-to-be-creative-claude-shannons-long-lost-1952-speech-fbbcb2ebe07f">Claude
    Shannon's "Creative Thinking" Speech: A Genius Reveals How To Be Creative</a>
<blockquote>
<em>
Then there's the idea of dissatisfaction. By this I don't mean a
pessimistic dissatisfaction of the world &mdash; we don't like the way things
are &mdash; I mean a constructive dissatisfaction. The idea could be expressed
in the words, This is OK, but I think things could be done better. I
think there is a neater way to do this. I think things could be improved
a little. In other words, there is continually a slight irritation when
things don't look quite right; and I think that dissatisfaction in
present days is a key driving force in good scientists.
</p>
<p>
...<br>
Well now, this is all well and good, but supposing a person has these
three properties to a sufficient extent to be useful, are there any
tricks, any gimmicks that he can apply to thinking that will actually
aid in creative work, in getting the answers in research work, in
general, in finding answers to problems? I think there are, and I think
they can be catalogued to an certain extent.
...
</p>
<p>
The first one that I might speak of is the idea of
simplification. Suppose that you are given a problem to solve, I don't
care what kind of a problem &mdash; a machine to design, or a physical theory
to develop, or a mathematical theorem to prove, or something of that
kind &mdash; probably a very powerful approach to this is to attempt to
eliminate everything from the problem except the essentials; that is,
cut it down to size. Almost every problem that you come across is
befuddled with all kinds of extraneous data of one sort or another; and
if you can bring this problem down into the main issues, you can see
more clearly what you're trying to do and perhaps find a solution. ...

Richard Hamming's advice on doing great research: <a
href="http://www.paulgraham.com/hamming.html"><em>You and Your
Research</em></a> (Talk at Bellcore, 7 March 1986)
<blockquote>
<em>
Over on the
other side of the dining hall was a chemistry table. I had worked with
one of the fellows, Dave McCall; furthermore he was courting our
secretary at the time. I went over and said, "Do you mind if I join
you?" They can't say no, so I started eating with them for a while. And
I started asking, "What are the important problems of your field?" And
after a week or so, "What important problems are you working on?" And
after some more time I came in one day and said, "If what you are doing
is not important, and if you don't think it is going to lead to
something important, why are you at Bell Labs working on it?" I wasn't
welcomed after that; I had to find somebody else to eat with!...
<p> 
If you do not work on an important problem, it's unlikely you'll do
important work...
</em>
<div class="rightnote">
This line is frequently quoted (included
in <a href="http://gradschool.unc.edu/events/hooding/2012/">Levoy's
talk</a>), and seems obviously right, but I think its wrong and dangerous!  Much better to work on obviously fun
problems, than obviously important ones.
See <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/thescian/2008/03/11/what-are-worthwhile-problems-f/">Richard
Feynman's letter to Koichi Mano</a> for a better perspective on this.
</div>
<p>
<em>
I notice that if you have the door to your office closed, you get more
work done today and tomorrow, and you are more productive than most. But
10 years later somehow you don't know quite know what problems are worth
working on; all the hard work you do is sort of tangential in
importance. He who works with the door open gets all kinds of
interruptions, but he also occasionally gets clues as to what the world
is and what might be important.

Marc Levoy's <a href="http://gradschool.unc.edu/events/hooding/2012/"><em>Where do disruptive ideas come from?</em></a> (hooding ceremony speech at
the University of North Carolina)
<blockquote>
<em>
For three years I lived next door to Facebook. Literally next door. I
could throw a rock from my bedroom window and break a window in Mark
Zuckerberg's office. They have a particular culture at Facebook: young,
edgy, in-your-face. Their walls are covered with graffiti and posters,
spray-painted in Wild West Wanted-dead-or-alive font. One of them says:
"Move fast, break things." Their offices have concrete floors, no
interior walls and lots of skateboards, so I imagine they do break things.
My favorite poster says, "What would you do if you weren't afraid?"
Being afraid is useful. On the savannah it kept us from being eaten by
lions. Nevertheless, this is the message I'd like to leave you with, the
same message my mentor Don Greenberg gave to me. Know your fears, know
also what you really want, weigh the odds, and occasionally, make a run
for it.</em>

for New Graduate Students</em></a>

<em>
I must caution you, though, about an important enemy against this kind
of informal interactions. The Internet. Okay, so my research focuses on
the Internet, so it may seem strange for me to be so negative about it,
but this is important so I'll make an exception. The Internet makes it
far too easy to work from home, or a cafe, or on the train, rather than
in your office or lab with your peers. Your choice to work away from the
office is, in fact, perfectly rational. Coming into the office has a
defined cost, in terms of your time and (perhaps) having to get out of
your pajamas and take a shower. And, all of this is in exchange for some
vague, speculative benefit -- that you might have a chance encounter 
that truly changes your research. And, frankly, in any one day, you 
probably won't have a profound experience in your office, and your
officemates may not even be in the same scholarly mood as you. But, I
entreat you to go anyway.

Alan Turing's advice on finishing a PhD thesis (from a letter to his
mother, 7 May 1938)
<blockquotE><em>
My Ph. D. thesis has been delayed a good deal more than I expected.
Church made a number of suggestions which resulted in the thesis being
expanded to an appalling length.  I hope the length of it won't make it
difficult to get it published.  I lost some time too when getting it
typed by a professional typist here.  I took it to a firm which was very
well spoken of, but they put a very incompetent girl onto it.  She would
copy things down wrong on every page from the original, which was almost
entirely in type.  I made long lists of corrections to be done and even
then it would not be right. ...
I had an offer of a job here as von Neumann's assistant at $1,500 a year

Steven Hughes' <a href="http://www.indiana.edu/~kruschke/lab/tipping.html"><em>Academic
Tipping Guidelines</em></a>
<blockquote><em>
 A dwindling minority of traditionalists still oppose academic tipping;
 they instead cling to the old system whereby graduate students curried
 favor by emulating the thoughts and actions of their major professor,
 thus promulgating the "old fogy's" persona indefinitely. Clearly, this
 antiquated system stifled academic creativity far too long.
<p>
A good analogy to academic tipping has operated effectively in the
United States Congress for over 150 years. Congressmen are given "tips"
in the form of campaign contributions or such other gratuities for a job
well done. Furthermore, it is well documented that no Congressman has
ever shown preferential treatment toward any of his or her satisfied
"constituents" (Thomas "Tip" O'Neill 1987).

When setting up the interview, I requested ... a 15-30 minute break
before the talk. Although I only needed about 10 minutes, I asked for 30
because of schedule slip. This should be in a room by yourself, so you
can collect your thoughts, calm down, and flip through your slides one
last time (which doesn't help the talk but is a calming ritual). This is
more important than I realized. At the one place I didn't get this, my
talk went very poorly, though I can't put my finger on exactly why,
except maybe my unnecessarily heightened nerves. At another place I was
given time but not a room; when I sat in the lounge or the seminar room, I couldn't escape people interested in chatting with me, so I excused myself to the bathroom and sat there for five minutes. The talk went great.

other types of communication like how to run meetings).

<em>
A clear purpose for the meeting is the first step towards success. If the
meeting has no purpose, you shouldn't meet. When you think about your
purpose, try to define it in terms of a product that you want at the end

statement for the meeting because it describes a process, not a product.

<h3>Teaching</h3>

Paul Lockhart's advice on teaching (focused on teaching mathematics, but
applies to all teaching): <a
href="http://radian.org/~krstic/LockhartsLament.pdf"><em>Lockhart's
Lament</em></a> [PDF]
<blockquote>
<em>
Teaching is not about information. It's about having an honest
intellectual relationship with your students. It requires no method, no
tools, and no training. Just the ability to be real. And if you can't be
real, then you have no right to inflict yourself upon innocent children.
...
It may be true that you have to be able to read in order to fill out
forms at the DMV, but that's not why we teach children to read. We
teach them to read for the higher purpose of allowing them access to
beautiful and meaningful ideas.

  develop interview today, and suggests a better approach.  (Quite a bit
  of this applies to faculty recruiting interviews, which as done today
  are typically even stranger and less connected to what matters than
  software developer interviews.)

<blockquote>
<em>
Years from now, we'll look back at the 2015 developer interview as an
anachronism, akin to hiring an orchestra cellist with a personality test
and a quiz about music theory rather than a blind audition... Engineering teams are not infantry squads. They aren't selected for
their ability to perform under unnatural stress. But that's what most
interview processes demand, often &mdash; as is the case with every interview
that assesses "confidence" &mdash; explicitly so.
