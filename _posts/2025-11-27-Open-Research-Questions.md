A list of open research questions. These are of varying depth of thought; some might be personal interest questions, while others might be open for research.

# Computer Science Questions

### RQ1: Price of Anarchy
What's the price of anarchy for independent Q-learning as opposed to centralized Q-learning (with respect to some social welfare optimal metric)?

### RQ2: Stability in Games
Is the Nash bargaining solution an evolutionary stable state? How does stability of NE relate to the  eigenvalues of the bimatrix game, relative to some 'best response' or MWU/Hedge dynamic?

### RQ3: LLMs
Do LLMs use probabilistic reasoning and would they fail the Ellsberg paradox?

### RQ4: Adverarial ML
What's the query complexity for inferring model weights given the output of a model?

### RQ5: Strategic ML in Federated Learning
How are adversaries handled in federated learning, if an edge compute device wants to influence the parameter vector of a central server? Is VCG needed in order to incentivize edge devices to report their parameter vectors correctly?

### RQ6: Distortion
What is the distortion of distributed SLAM? As in, if there are communication constraints, what is the process for (1) determining which information is most needed to be communicated, (2) error rates on correctness as a function of the partial information?

### RQ7: Epistemology and Expertise
What's the philosophy or reason behind becoming an expert at something? Besides intellectual novelty, there are cognitive skills learned by thinking about a problem non-stop for 4+ years straight. What is the change?


# Political Economics Questions

### RQ1: Executive and Labor Salaries
Are executives' marginal contributions to the company worth their bonuses? How does marginal performance and compensation on teams correlate with Shapley values? To what extent is compensation correlated with someone's ability to unilaterally impact a company's bottom line (upside or downside via regular operations)? How do we measure marginal impact, and how far off is marginal compensation from what is 'fair'?

### RQ2: Wealth Inquality and Prices
What is the relationship between wealth inequality and local prices? As in, how are prices a function of local net wealth / incomes, and the city/county-wide GINI index?

### RQ3: Labor and Earning Potential
Correlation of earning potential with high school GPA, or amount of extra-curriculars taken in middle school, high school, and college?

### RQ4: Curriculum and School Choice
Are curriculum adaptive enough for changing labor demands? Both in public and private schools. Also, how does the use of school choice vouchers change curriculum and education standards?

### RQ5: Flux of Capital
Can we capture the 'flux' of money / liquidity in certain communities?
What makes a community 'self sufficient' both in terms of (# gas stations per capita, # banks or religious or community institutions, etc) and (independent sovereign communities)? How big of a community before people start ‘relying’ on others (or, in other words, require more complex financial systems)? Or needing a different currency system (e.g., does Gaza/ West Bank use NIS)? What does ‘community institutions’ mean and how is their use correlated with quality of life and GDP?

### RQ6: Trust in Instiutions in the 2020s
What institutions and authorities do consumers have trust in, and where should they based on certain objective measures? E.g., FDA vs EWG

### RQ7: Successes and Failures of 'The Market'
Where does 'the market' succeed or fail at building resilient social infrastructure (as a function of e.g., community spaces, architecture, religious institutions, etc)?

### RQ8: Living Wage Contributors
It is ethically arguable that people should get a living wage for an honest day's work. However, a significant percentage of jobs in the US economy don't offer this necessity. What are the causes for this, such as (1) what jobs does this happen, (2) what personal finance and education/skills does a person find themselves with, or (3) what macroeconomic factors contribute to this)? For instance, Walmart has a cutoff in their labor pool for self-sustaining 40 hr/week positions. Consider this for both companies whose margins can, and cannot, support such a salary, relative to the market for a specific type of labor altogether.

### RQ9: Labor elasticity and epistemic resilience
The relationship between labor supply in different geographical areas and elasticity for where people are willing to move, depending on how specialized of a skill set the job is. How does supply/demand ratios for certain specialized skill sets affect epistemic resilience in the economy?


### RQ10: Microeconomic network effects
To what extent can we measure income of companies as a function of expenditures from other companies? E.g., how does Firestone’s income in a city depend on the success of other companies in a city? If the city was all-Firestone, then it would fail. But diversity, plus positive exchange of capital and growth vis a vis loans means that the service industry can survive. My intuition suggests that deleveraging doom-loops are inevitable but certain mechanisms enable time-to-death to be kicked down the road indefinitely.


### RQ11: Credit Scores
What are the most significant causal features for peoples' credit scores? To what extent are people in structural deficit environemts as opposed to making poor choices?

### RQ12: Random Walks
How robust are people, based on their choices throughout a given week, to sensitive shocks? This is similar to the finding of X% people living paycheck-to-paycheck, but more specific.


### RQ13: Inflation
How is inflation captured by liquid markets, such as Meta's auction platform?


### RQ14: Political deescalation
We know that tit-for-tat can cause political escalation, as discussed extensively by Axelrod and Schelling. What are mechanisms or requirements that can deescalate political tension? Do both players need to have a vested interest in accepting sunk costs in favor of future peace?

### RQ15: Tacit Knowledge
How do we systematically measure tacit knowledge? Is it related to how efficient a team or company is at getting someone new to get up to speed? If a consulting company like BCG is recommending cutting labor for cost savings, how should they measure how concentrated certain knowledge is about the company and the price for recouping that knowledge?

# Other

### RQ1: Myths
How do myths, as Joseph Campbell discusses, play out in our daily lives?
