Welcome! This blog is to provide a space for me to share assorted knowledge I've synthesized, books I've reviewed, and concepts I've drawn insights about. I expect it to be an evolving space, not strictly related to my research, and one that will hopefully be more interactive in time. Enjoy!


### Who Am I?

Professionally: I am a PhD student in artificial intelligence at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. I am fascinated by formal methods of decision making: inter-dependent, strategic, and under uncertainty -- leading me to research *computational social choice*, *multiagent systems*, and *reinforcement learning*. 

Check out my professional website [here](http://homepages.rpi.edu/%7Ekavnej/)!

Personally: I am a dancer (swing, jazz, improvisation), hiker, musician, reader, and photographer. I also have some interest in political economy, political philosophy, environmentalism, sustainability, epistemology, and world religions.
