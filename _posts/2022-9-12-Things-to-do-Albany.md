title: Things to do in and around Albany
---

Moving to a new city for college (or graduate school) for the first time is a new and exciting opportunity, but it is also a scary and sometimes overwhelming experience. As you're hitting the ground running with classes and work, you also have to figure out a new routine, shop and cook, take care of yourself and your new home, and create new communities. I've therefore decided to compile a list of resources for things to do in the areas I've stayed. Hopefully these can help you find what you like to do if you pass by these areas, too!
