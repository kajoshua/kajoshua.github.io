title: So You Want to go to Grad School...

5/9/23

By the end of your program, you will have the ability to read others' papers and decipher what you're reading, condense the material to it's primary conclusions and take-aways, and summarize it for layfolk. You will have the ability to do your own research and know how to ask good questions, know which types of problems are feasible or not, write to convey information to other people, and convince stakeholders of the relevance of your work. And many of these skills will seem trivial to you because you've spent the last 5+ years exposed to your field and working to get better at it every day. Compare this to the beginning of your program where you were daunted by the idea of doing research and had no idea how to even get started. This is how most people -- even non-PhD professionals -- conceive of research: "some smart or very experienced person wrote this program or white paper or documentation." When you graduate with your PhD, you will be one of these experts. Even if you've only published one or a handful of papers through your graduate schooling, your degree declares that you are competent. To a future corporate employer, this says that you are the most qualified person to do the job of pushing a company's knowledge to the next level. I'd estimate a PhD to be 75% necessary and 95% sufficient for these types of jobs: a driven professional can do it too after a lot of experience, but the doctoral certification proves your competency.
