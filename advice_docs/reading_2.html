<h1>How to Read a Technical Paper</h1>
<h4>by Jason Eisner (2009)</h4>

<h2>Multi-pass reading</h2>

<p>Skim the paper first, skipping over anything that would take much
mental effort.  Just get an idea of where the paper is going, why it
was written, what's old hat and what's new to you.  To force yourself
to keep moving, give yourself a
<A HREF="http://www.online-stopwatch.com/countdown-clock/full-screen/?ns=../../s/1.mp3">limited time budget</A> per
page or use the autoscroll feature of your PDF reader.</p>

<p>Now, assuming the paper still seems worthwhile, go back and read
the whole thing more carefully.</p>

<p>Why not practice on this webpage?  Go ahead, skim it first.</p>

reading</A> in detail: What are you trying to do on each pass?</p>
</small></blockquote>

<h2>Write as you read</h2>

<p>Write as you read.  This keeps your attention focused and makes you engage
  with the paper.</p>

<h3>Low-level notes</h3>

<p>Often it is easiest to scribble notes on the printed-out paper
   itself, responding in context to the formulas, figures, and text.
   In that case, file or scan your annotated copy for future reference.</p>

<p>(Or perhaps
   <A
   HREF="http://www.google.com/search?q=annotate+pdf+linux">annotate
   the PDF <i>file</i></A> directly, without printing or scanning.  A
   free alternative to Acrobat is <A
   HREF="http://www.docu-track.com/home/prod_user/PDF-XChange_Tools/pdfx_viewer/">PDF-XChange
   Viewer</A>, a Windows program that can also be <A
   HREF="http://www.google.com/search?q=annotate+pdf+linux">run on
     Linux</A> via <A HREF="http://www.winehq.org/">wine</A>.  A free
   native Linux option is <A HREF="http://xournal.sourceforge.net/">Xournal</A>.)</p>

<p>You can use notes on the paper to</p>
<ul>
  <li>restate unclear points in your own words
  <li>fill in missing details (assumptions, algebraic steps, proofs, pseudocode)
  <li>annotate mathematical objects with their types
  <li>come up with examples that illustrate the author's ideas, <i>and</i> examples that would be problematic for the author
  <li>draw connections to other methods and problems you know about
  <li>ask questions about things that aren't stated or that don't make sense
  <li>challenge the paper's claims or methods
  <li>dream up followup work that you (or someone) should do
  </ul>


<h3>High-level notes</h3>

<p>Low-level notes aren't enough.  Also keep high-level notes about
papers.  You should try to distill the paper down: summarize the
things that interested you, contrast with other papers, and record
your own questions and ideas for future work.  Writing this
distillation gives you a goal while reading the paper, and the notes
will be useful to you later.</p>

<blockquote><small> Michael Mitzenmacher <A
  HREF="https://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~michaelm/postscripts/ReadPaper.pdf">writes</A>:
  "Read <i>creatively</i>. Reading a paper critically is easy, in that
  it is always easier to tear something down than to build it
  up. Reading creatively involves harder, more positive thinking.
  What are the good ideas in this paper? Do these ideas have other
  applications or extensions that the authors might not have thought
  of? Can they be generalized further? Are there possible improvements
  that might make important practical differences? If you were going
  to start doing research from this paper, what would be the next
  thing you would do?"
</small></blockquote>

<p>At a minimum, you should re-explain the ideas in your own words:
produce some text that is aimed at your future self.  You should be
able to reread this later and quickly reconstruct your understanding
of the paper.  Don't waste time repeating the parts that are easy for
you.  Include a URL to the original paper, and refer as needed to the
paper's Figure 1, equation (2), section 3.3, etc.  But do spend time
writing down hard-won bits of understanding:</p>

<blockquote>
    "They don't say this, but equation (2) is basically the same as
    the method of Pookie (2001), except that they add a
    reconfabulation step after the data pur&eacute;e.  I was surprised
    at their reconfabulator, which doesn't match what I would have
    expected from Kachu (2004), but it does cure the exponential
    growth problem in this domain.  To see the difference, I found it
    useful to think about this example: ..."
</blockquote>

<h3>Organizing your notes</h3>

<p>I suggest sorting your file of notes chronologically, by when you
  read the paper, since that may help you find vaguely remembered
  papers or remember what else you were reading at the time.
  Sometimes you'll want to search by author/title/etc., so start the
  notes for each paper with a rough citation.  (See also <A
  HREF="how-to-organize-your-files.html">How to Organize Your
  Files</A>.)</p>

<p>If you had to put a lot of effort into really understanding some
point, you can share that effort with others (and record it for your
own future reference) by improving the discussion of that point on the
relevant Wikipedia page.</p>

<p>Many people have devised software or personal systems for annotating
  papers and keeping track of notes.  Quora users give their recommendations <a href="http://www.quora.com/PhD-students-How-do-you-keep-your-notes-while-reading-scientific-papers/?share=1">here</A>
and <a href="http://www.quora.com/PhD-Students/What-wiki-blog-software-do-you-use-to-maintain-personal-notes-of-your-daily-reading-research/?share=1">here</A>.</p>

<h2>When and where to read</h2>

<p>Start early.  Leave enough time that if your attention wanders, you
can put the paper down and pick it up again when you're in a better
reading mood.  This is better than trying to force yourself through it
on a deadline.</p>

<p>Some people find it easier to read at particular times of day, or
while eating or walking or riding an exercise bike.
Do you habitually pick up the closest thing to read when you're at
the breakfast table or in the bathroom?  Then leave papers there for yourself.</p>

<p><b>Try reading with a friend!</b> Sit next to each other, looking
  at the same copy of the paper, and stay synchronized at the
  paragraph or sentence level.  Read aloud at times.  You'll keep each
  other moving and help each other through the hard parts.  Discuss as
  you go along.</p>

<h2>Set aside time</h2>

<p>When you are starting out in a new area, it may take you hours to
read a conference paper thoroughly.  That's okay.  It's worth spending
that much time to really understand a good or foundational paper.  It
will pay off in your future reading and research.</p>

<p><b>I'll never find the time!</b> Don't worry.  Not all papers take
that long.  Many ideas are reused across papers, so you will get
faster at reading.  By now, in an area I know well, I can often read a
paper in 30 minutes or less, because the motivation is familiar and I
can recognize much of the setup as standard practice.  (After all,
most papers fall into an existing tradition.  They extend existing
work with one or two genuine new ideas, and some supporting details
that may or may not be significant.)</p>

<p><b>But I'm already a third-year student.  Why is this paper taking
me so long?</b> There is no shame in reading slowly.  It still takes
me several hours to absorb a paper on something that I genuinely don't
know well.  (Also, it takes me hours to <i>review</i> a paper even in my
own area, because the burden is on me to spot all the problems or
opportunities for improvement.  75% of submitted conference papers are
rejected, and most of the remaining 25% also need improvement before
publication.)</p>

<h2>Which parts to focus on</h2>

<p>So do you really have to read the <i>whole</i> paper carefully on your
second pass?  Sometimes, but not always.  It depends on why you're
reading the paper.</p>

<p>I do think that when you are learning a new area, you should read
at least <i>some</i> papers extremely thoroughly.  That means knowing
what every sentence and every subscript is doing, so that you really
learn all of the techniques used in the paper.  And understanding why
things were done as they were: <a href="http://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/ask-yourself-dumb-questions-%E2%80%93-and-answer-them/">ask
yourself dumb questions and answer them</a>.  Practice the
<i>ability</i> to decode the <i>entire</i> paper&mdash;as if you were
reviewing it critically and trying to catch any errors, sloppy
thinking, or incompleteness.  This will sharpen your critical
thinking.  You will want to turn this practiced critical eye on
yourself as you plan, execute, and write up your own research.</p>

<p>However, there will also be occasional papers where it is not worth reading
all the details right now.  Maybe the details are of limited interest,
or you simply don't feel equipped to understand them yet.  Consider
the parts of a typical paper:</p>

<ul>

  <li><p><b>Motivation.</b> You'll want to understand this fairly
  well, or there's no point in reading the paper at all.  But part of
  the motivation may depend on things you don't know (mathematical
  background or past work).  If you don't want to chase those references
  down now, you could just raise their priority on your reading list.

  <li><p><b>Mathematics and algorithms.</b> These parts are the
  technical heart of the paper.  So don't make a habit of skimming
  them.  (You can learn a lot from how the authors solved
  <i>their</i> problems.)  Nonetheless, you might skim a technical
  section if</p>

  <ul>
    <li><p>It seems like an explanation of something you already know.
    In that case, just check that it really says what you think.</p>

    <li><p>While you probably would benefit right away from knowing
    the method in detail, this paper is just not a good place to learn
    it, or it is too advanced for you right now.  Understand what you
    reasonably can, and then put it on your list of things to learn
    for real.  Perhaps ask someone else to explain it to you or to
    recommend a reading.</p>

    <li><p>It seems like an ugly <i>ad hoc</i> solution that no one
    would ever want to use anyway.  The only reason to understand it
    fully would be if you wanted to criticize it or improve upon it.

    (Still, even if you skip the ugly details, understand what the authors'
    intuitions were.  Think about how to capture those intuitions more
    elegantly.)</p>

    <li><p>It's enough to know for now that the method exists.  It
    seems specialized, so you might never need it.  You'll come back
    to the paper if you do.</p>

    <p>But you should still achieve clarity now about what the method
    accomplishes (its interface).  Also try to glean when it is
    applicable, how hard it would be to use, and what determines its
    runtime and accuracy.  Then you'll remember the method when you need it.</p>

    <p>What you might skip for now are the hard parts: the internal
    workings of the method
    (its implementation) and any proofs of correctness or efficiency.
    </p>

  </ul>

  <li><p><b>Experiments.</b> Many papers test their methods
  empirically.  When you're new to a field, you should examine
  carefully how this is typically done (and whether you approve!).
  It can also be helpful to notice what datasets and code
  were used&mdash;as you may want to use them yourself in future.</p>

  <p>But once you've learned the ropes, you may not always care so
  much about a paper's experiments.  After all, sometimes you're only
  reading the paper to stoke your creativity with some new problems or
  techniques.  I confess that I often pay less attention to the
  experimental details&mdash;though examples or error analysis do catch
  my attention because they often shed light.

  <p>If you do care about the conclusions of the paper ("did the
  method work?" "should I use it?"), then you should go back and
  carefully examine the experimental design, including the choice of
  data.  Were the experiments fair?  Do they support the claims?
  What's really going on?  Are the conclusions likely to generalize beyond
  this experimental scenario?</p>

</ul>

<p>In short, invest your time wisely.  Focus on what is valuable to
take away.  <i>If you can't figure out which parts of the paper are
most "interesting" or "important," do ask someone who should know!</i>
If you don't know who to ask, find other papers that cite this one
(via <A HREF="http://scholar.google.com">Google Scholar</A>) and see
what they say about this paper.</p>

<blockquote> <small>Delip Rao suggests: "Never read the original paper on
  X first. Instead read several later papers on what they say about X,
  get an idea of X and then read the original paper. Somehow the
  research community is much better in explaining ideas clearly than
  the original authors themselves."</small></blockquote>
