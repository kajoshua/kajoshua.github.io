  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">An undergraduate completing 
    a directed studies project with me is expected to complete his/her project 
    by handing in a report following the guidelines outlined here, on a mutually-agreed 
    due date at the end of the term. While specifics of a project with me vary 
    and will have been agreed on individually with me, the general type of projects 
    in my group generally fall into one of three broad categories which I'll refer 
    to below where relevant: </font></p>
</div>
<ul>
  <li> 
    <div align="left"> <b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">experimental:</font></b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> 
      you built an experiment setup and conducted human-subject experiments to 
      answer some psychological question.<br>
      <br>
      </font></div>
  </li>
  <li> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>conceptual design</b>: 
    you analyzed an interface application and then performed the conceptual design 
    for a physical interface for that application. You did a combination of prototyping 
    which involved some level of form studies, paper prototypes and interactive 
    computer-based simulation; and you obtained some form of potential-user feedback 
    based on these prototypes.<br>
    <br>
    </font></li>
  <li> <b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">engineering design 
    and/or prototyping:</font></b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> 
    you designed and built an engineering prototype of some kind of physical interface; 
    possibly based on someone else's conceptual model, or possibly out of your 
    own ideas.</font></li>
</ul>
<div align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The report's 
  principle purpose is to be of value in documenting the project such that <b>a 
  later researcher can benefit from the work that you did</b>. When composing 
  it, imagine yourself as that researcher reading your report and ask yourself:</font></div>
<ul>
  <li> 
    <div align="left"> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Do 
      I understand <i><b>why</b></i> the work was undertaken in the first place? 
      What is the point of it?</font></div>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <div align="left"> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Can 
      I understand <i><b>what</b></i> was done, exactly? Is the language clear 
      and are the figures and photographs supportive?</font></div>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <div align="left"> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Is 
      there sufficient detail so I can <i><b>critique</b></i> the work and decide 
      whether I agree with the conclusions, and even the approach?</font></div>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <div align="left"> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Can 
      I in all essential details <i><b>reproduce</b></i> the experiment / concept 
      / hardware solely from the supplied documentation?</font></div>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">A good report will <i>not</i> 
  include any information or material which does not support these goals, since 
  that would make it unnecessarily long and difficult to read.</font></p>
<table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" bgcolor="#8FBC8D">
  <tr> 
    <td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><a name="length"></a>LENGTH 
      &amp; Format</b></font></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">How long should your report 
  be? It will vary depending on the requirements of the project. However, you 
  should be able to get the message across in about 8-10 pages single spaced, 
  11pt font, with compact and carefully chosen figures. <b>This does not include 
  appendices which may be as long as they need to be.</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">For appropriate level of 
  density, look at any conference or journal paper, e.g. those on the <a href="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/labs/spin/publications/index.html">SPIN 
  website</a>. You may use a conference paper formatting template if you like 
  (e.g. the ACM <a href="confFormat.doc">conference format</a>); it is fine if 
  you do not, however try to maintain this level of density so that the report 
  will not become overly long.</font></p>
