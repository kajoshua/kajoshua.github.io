title: My Lindy Academia
---

Two groups lie at the forefront of my personal identity: academia and the Lindy Hop community. During the day I am embedded as a regular Ph.D. student at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. I work on many research projects involving computational theories of group decision-making, coding simulations and experiments, writing papers, and presenting lectures and posters. I collaborate with professors and postdocs and participate in academic seminars as a speaker, reviewer, and attendee. The night is for dancing. [Lindy hop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkonZbTj2wE&ab_channel=KQEDArts) is a Black American swing dance that originated in the 1920s from Harlem, New York City. The dance holds a [rich history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Lindy_Hop), including breaking race barriers, and has culturally influenced many forms of American dance and music in the modern era. It is now danced all around the world at scale from 20-person swing syndicates at local bars to international championships with >500 people and 8-piece big bands.

Through talking with friends in both communities I continue to find ideas that overlap the two. Academics ask me about this overlap while dancers wonder how Lindy Hop attracts so many engineers. This blog complies 3 such areas of similarity. In particular, I focus on my own experience with this dance form rather than its historical context and other peoples' relationships with it.

## Areas of Similarities

### 1) Role as an active student

The idea of being a student of dance isn't new, as many universities have Bachelor of Fine Arts in Dance programs, but it is notable that Lindy Hop was originally a street dance. Today, people learn the dance by taking classes from either their peers, who have more experience, or career teachers, who are experts and often tour nationally and internationally. This method is scalable and more accessible to people who are familiar with the industrial method of American schooling, but it didn't used to be this way. Rather than pay to be taught specific concepts, people experimented with their own movement, saw things that they liked, and emulated and inspired each other. This is still present at the advanced levels and is a common trait amongst both academics and dancers.

Academics pass through four stages in their schooling:
- Undergraduate / Master's: to learn the foundation of a specific discipline while training the skill of learning new concepts
- Graduate (Ph.D.): to indepedently learn technical expertise in a specific field, extend prior work to develop new knowledge, and practice teaching others new developments
- Postdoc / fellow: to continue pushing the boundaries of the field under the guidance of a professor or an institutional scholarship
- Professor: to advance research programs, teach, and train new researchers

Students first aquire a base of knowledge before becoming an expert in their field, advancing knowledge, and subsequently teaching others. I conceptualize Ph.D. schooling as a skill tree in a video game. The branches span *technical abilities* in one's field, *literacy skills* to read, write, and speak comprehensively, and *character traits* like discipline in the face of adversary and creativity to invent new solutions. Every "player" gains sufficient skill in all areas through undergrad. As the student specializes in their field, they identify and work on the skills that are underdeveloped with the end goal of publishing their findings.

Lindy Hop dancers follow a similar pathway. First, a student learns the dance and a variety of skills that improve the overall quality of their dancing ability. Once a dancer reaches a certain caliber, then they become aware of what skills they lack and what skills they need to focus on in order to improve. Like a graduate student, an advanced dancer figures out the right questions to ask. The equivalent branches in this skill tree analogy include rhythmic precision in a dancer's body movement, fluidity in a dancer and their partner's momentum, ability to improvise, non-verbal communication, and performance presentation. 

Like postdocs, there is an equivalent [dance research fellowship](https://www.nypl.org/dance-fellowship), where the aim is similarly to push the boundaries of dance in exchange for funding and workshop space. Career teachers, like professors, understand their field well enough to compete, generate novel techniques within the dance, and teach students at all levels.



### 2) Conferences and Competitions

Academics have conferences (e.g., AAAI, IJCAI, ICML, KDD, WWW, etc.) while dancers have [festivals and competitions](https://www.swingplanit.com/) (e.g., ILHC, Lindy Focus, Snowball, Beantown Camp, Camp Jitterbug, etc.) (and even a [cruise](https://lindycruise.com/)!). Here are five ways they compare:

1. Travel
-- (Academia) Travel regionally, nationally, or internationally
-- (Lindy) Travel regionally, nationally, or internationally

2. Classes
-- (Academia) Paper and poster presentations, workshops, and tutorials
-- (Lindy) Series or elective classes

3. Headliner
-- (Academia) Keynote lecture 
-- (Lindy) Performances

4. Social
-- (Academia) Professional networking
-- (Lindy) Social dance with live music

5. Competitions
-- (Academia) Competitions and technical challenges
-- (Lindy) Competitions at varying skill levels (open, advanced, invitational) and format (draw, solo, team, strictly)


### 3) Scale of interactions



>>> Local has reading groups and local seminars. International conferences.


### 5) Creativity vs analytics




## Areas of Difference

### 1) Hobby

Most people treat dance as a hobby which is physically active and they get to enjoy dancing, music, and non-professional socializing. Academia has none of these. People can participate in dance to just have fun without intentional training and worrying about their skill and practice, whereas even academic side-projects involve training and applying a particular specialized skill.
