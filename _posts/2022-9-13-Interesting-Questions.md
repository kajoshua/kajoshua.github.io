title: Interesting Questions
---

A small collection of interesting (boundary breaker) questions you can ask people instead of making smalltalk with "What do you do (for a living)?" This list is motivated, in part, by [David Goodhart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ex3TPdsBsY){:target="_blank"}. Enjoy!

* Who are you?
* What is a conversation that you would like to have with someone, but haven't found the right moment yet?
* What is something that you know you'll never reasonably do in your life? How do you feel knowing you won't have that experience?
* Do you feel social pressure to [wear socks], or do you like them?
* What did you do last [Tuesday at 3pm]?
* What's your third favorite [INSERT]? (Source: Jessie Finocchiaro)
* Song recommendation? (Source: Anonymous I met at [CincyHop, 2022](https://cincyhop.org/wp/){:target="_blank"})
* What do you think about when your mind wanders?
* What is one thing you trying to improve about yourself or your community?
* What is one piece of knowledge or advice you can offer, based on your profession, specialty, or interests?
* If you had three extra hours, one day a week, how would you spend it?
