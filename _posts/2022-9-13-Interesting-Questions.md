title: Interesting Questions
---

A small collection of interesting (boundary breaker) questions you can ask people instead of making small talk with "What do you do for a living?" This list is motivated, in part, by [this lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ex3TPdsBsY){:target="_blank"} by David Goodhart. Enjoy!

* Who are you?
* What is a conversation that you would like to have with someone, but haven't found the right moment yet?
* Do you feel social pressure to [wear socks], or do you like them?
* What did you do last [Tuesday at 3pm]?
* What's your third favorite [place to visit]?

* What do you think about when your mind wanders?
* What is one thing you trying to improve about yourself or your community?
* What is one piece of knowledge or advice you can offer, based on your profession, specialty, or interests?
* If you had three extra hours, one day a week, how would you spend it?
* What are some things you don't usually like to do, but still want to try every once in awhile?
* What is something that you know you'll never (reasonably) do in your life?
* Are you someone who usually reaches out to others or do others reach out to you?
