(1) Theoretical understanding of how the brain works for most contemporary humans
(2) Empirical assessment of X has been conducted in the literature, and peer-review process as it existed at the time that X was being validated is an appropriate measure for establishing X as a contemporary standard with high confidence
(3) Is this being communicated accurately? Did Tharp actually suggest this statement to Schwager in the interview that's being presented by Schwager to audiences? Is X edited in a way during the book writing process to accurately reflect the context of the interview?
(4) How will I, the reader, remember this statement (with error), communicate it to others (with error), or refer others to the actual location of this statement, assuming that precise copies of this book (with exact has values) are prolific and easily accessible to others?
(5) Is this statement easily verifiable for a new reader, in easily accessible literature? Assuming (A) the libraries I visit aren't doctored; (B) this is a single claim so we don't have to worry about balance for/against X in the literature, just that it exists; (C) X is an accurate representation of what the literature actually represents.
